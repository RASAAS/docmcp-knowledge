# Equivalent Device

In the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP), if the plan is to use clinical data from one or more legally marketed medical devices (the "equivalent devices") to support the safety and performance of the device under evaluation, a dedicated section must be established to rigorously and comprehensively demonstrate this "equivalence." The core task of this section is to clearly and systematically demonstrate, in accordance with regulatory requirements (e.g., MDR Article 61(3) and Annex XIV Part A Section 3, with reference to guidance documents such as MDCG 2020-5), that there are no clinically significant differences between the device under evaluation and the selected equivalent device(s) in terms of clinical, technical, and biological characteristics.

## Criteria for Selecting Equivalent Devices

Before beginning the detailed comparison, the rationale and criteria for selecting specific devices as equivalent devices must be articulated. The selected equivalent device(s) should be legally marketed in the EU (typically bearing CE marking). Selection must not be based on superficial similarity alone but must withstand detailed comparison across three key dimensions:

1. **Clinical equivalence**: The device must be used for the same clinical condition (including similar disease state and severity), the same intended purpose (including similar therapeutic or diagnostic effects), a similar target population (considering age, anatomy, health status, etc.), and similar site of use and method of application.

2. **Technical equivalence**: The device must have a similar design and technical specifications (e.g., similar operating principle, key performance parameters, deployment method, and materials and design of key components), be used under similar conditions of use, and have similar software algorithms (if applicable).

3. **Biological equivalence**: The device must use the same or highly similar materials in contact with human tissue, with similar nature and duration of contact.

## Systematic Demonstration of Equivalence

The demonstration of equivalence is a systematic and detailed comparative process, not a simple listing. The CEP should outline this process and plan for the complete comparative data and analysis to be presented in the CER.

The core element is a **characteristic-by-characteristic comparison**. The device under evaluation must be compared side-by-side with each selected equivalent device across all relevant clinical, technical, and biological characteristics. A tabular format is commonly used to clearly present the specific manifestations of each characteristic across different devices. The comparison should cover:

- **Clinical characteristics**: Detailed comparison of every aspect of the intended use, scope of indications, precise definition of the target patient population, characteristics of the target disease or condition, specific site of use in the body, and differences in contraindications, warnings, and precautions
- **Technical characteristics**: In-depth analysis of design features (e.g., specific geometry, energy output parameters, software version), similarities and differences in mechanism of action or operating principle, key performance specifications (e.g., size range, mechanical strength, delivery system compatibility), sterilisation method and sterile barrier system, and whether single-use
- **Biological characteristics**: Explicitly list all materials in direct or indirect contact with the human body, assess biocompatibility data for these materials, and compare the nature and expected duration of contact with human tissue

## Identification and Analysis of Differences

In conducting the detailed characteristic-by-characteristic comparison, it is almost inevitable that some differences between the device under evaluation and the equivalent device(s) will be identified. All differences must be explicitly identified.

Once differences are identified, each difference must be subjected to in-depth scientific analysis and justification to demonstrate that these differences will not have a clinically significant negative impact on the safety and/or clinical performance of the device. This analysis requires:
- Clearly describing the nature and extent of the difference
- Explaining, based on scientific principles, engineering assessment, standard requirements, published literature, or specific preclinical studies (bench testing, animal studies), why the difference will not lead to different clinical outcomes (e.g., efficacy, complication rates, ease of use)
- For material differences: assessing potential impacts on biocompatibility, chemical properties, and physical properties
- For design or performance specification differences: assessing the impact on the device's ability to perform as intended in the planned clinical scenario

## Planning and Presenting the Equivalence Demonstration in the CEP

In this section of the CEP, clearly articulate the plan and methodology for the equivalence demonstration.

First, explicitly state which specific legally marketed device(s) are planned for equivalence comparison, and briefly state the primary rationale for selecting these devices.

Then, outline how the detailed comparison of clinical, technical, and biological characteristics will be conducted. Emphasise how differences will be systematically identified and how the clinical significance of these differences will be assessed and justified.

Finally, describe the planned approach for accessing the technical documentation of the equivalent device(s) (if the equivalent device is manufactured by the same manufacturer, or if a contract with the other manufacturer has been established per MDR Article 61(5)).
