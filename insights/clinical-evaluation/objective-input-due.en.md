# Objectives, Inputs and Device Under Evaluation

## Objective

The CEP must first articulate its core objective: to comprehensively confirm the safety and clinical performance of the device under evaluation for its intended use, in accordance with EU MDR 2017/745. This aims to satisfy the requirements of Article 61 on clinical evidence and to demonstrate that the device conforms to the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR), in particular GSPR 1 and GSPR 8.

This section should also describe the role of the CEP: a document that details how clinical data related to the device under evaluation will be systematically collected, appraised, and analysed. The collected data will be compared against the current generally acknowledged state of the art (SOTA) corresponding to the device's intended use under normal conditions of use. All findings and conclusions of the clinical evaluation will be fully documented in the Clinical Evaluation Report (CER).

## Input Documentation

The clinical evaluation must be based on sufficient and reliable existing information. The CEP must therefore explicitly list all input documents providing information for the clinical evaluation, including at minimum:

- **Document name/type**: e.g., the latest Instructions for Use (IFU), risk management documents (Risk Management Plan, Risk Analysis Report, Risk Management Report), preclinical study reports (bench testing, animal study reports), biocompatibility assessment report, design verification and validation reports
- **Document number**: for traceability
- **Date or version**: to ensure the latest valid version is used

## Device Under Evaluation

First, provide basic administrative information: the manufacturer's legal full name, address, and Single Registration Number (SRN). Where applicable, also list the EU Authorised Representative's name, address, and SRN.

The core is **Device Identification**. Describe in detail the device(s) covered by this clinical evaluation, typically starting with the trade name and specific model(s) or model range. State the current regulatory status (e.g., first application for MDR CE marking, or existing certification). A tabular format is recommended, including:

- **Model**
- **Description**: including main constituent materials, key components, basic technical parameters
- **CE Marking date**: if first application, state "N/A" or "Pending"
- **Classification**: risk class and applicable classification rule per MDR Annex VIII
- **Distribution Regions**
- Clear **product images or diagrams** are helpful for understanding

Describe the product's **Features/Functions**: illustrate the unique functions and design characteristics with text and images.

Describe the **Intended Use (Intended Purpose)**: the specific clinical indication(s), target patient population, anatomical location, and conditions of use. This is the foundation of the entire clinical evaluation.

Describe the **Contraindications**: conditions or patient populations for which the device should not be used.

Describe the **Intended Users**: the professional qualifications, training, and experience required to use the device safely.

Describe the **Intended Use Environment**: the clinical setting in which the device is intended to be used (e.g., hospital, outpatient clinic, home).

Describe the **Principle of Operation**: the physical, chemical, or biological mechanism by which the device achieves its intended purpose.
