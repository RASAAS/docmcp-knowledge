# Literature Screening Criteria

During the initial screening phase (reading titles and abstracts), only peer-reviewed literature published in English or Chinese that includes relevant clinical data will be included in the analysis. The specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows:

| **Inclusion Criteria** | **Exclusion Criteria** |
|---|---|
| 1. Peer-reviewed literature | 1. In vitro, preclinical, laboratory (including animal in vivo) studies |
| 2. Literature published in scientific, peer-reviewed journals | 2. Narrative reviews, abstracts, case reports, published article comments, emails |
| 3. Independent review literature | 3. Literature without quantitative outcome data |
| 4. Published controlled clinical trials | 4. Duplicate studies: data from the same cohort with similar time spans previously published |
| 5. Significant clinical experience data for comparator devices (only contributory data included; other data see Exclusion Criterion 5) | 5. Clinical trials of different technologies/devices (non-comparator devices) |
| 6. Unpublished clinical data | 6. Literature published in languages other than English/Chinese |
| 7. Literature in English or Chinese | |

> **Note**: For literature screening in compliance with EU MDR requirements, only **English** literature needs to be included.
