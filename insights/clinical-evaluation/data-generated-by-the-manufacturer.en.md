# Data Generated by the Manufacturer

Within the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP), the core objective of this chapter is to clearly and concisely outline the data that has been directly generated, is held by, or is directly accessible to the manufacturer, and which will serve as critical evidence in the clinical evaluation. This section aims to demonstrate to regulatory authorities the existing internal evidence base accumulated through the manufacturer's activities in support of the device's safety, performance, and conformity.

## Summary of Preclinical Study Data

Preclinical study data is fundamental to establishing the safety and functional basis of the device.

- **Product standards conformity**: Confirm the device's conformity with relevant product standards (e.g., specific harmonised or industry standards) during design and manufacture
- **Verification and Validation (V&V) activities**: Summarise results of completed bench tests, performance tests, mechanical integrity tests, electrical safety tests, and software validation, explaining how these confirm the device's functionality and safety
- **Biocompatibility assessment**: Briefly describe the scope and conclusions of biocompatibility assessments conducted for the device (particularly parts in direct or indirect contact with the human body), typically per ISO 10993 series standards
- **Preclinical animal studies** (if conducted): Overview of objectives, animal models used, key observation parameters, and principal study outcomes

For all mentioned preclinical studies, the CEP need only provide conclusive summaries; detailed study reports and data will be presented and analysed more comprehensively in the CER.

## Summary of Manufacturer-Sponsored Clinical Investigation Data (if any)

If the manufacturer has sponsored or is sponsoring any clinical investigations for the device under evaluation (completed, ongoing, or with preliminary data available):

- For each investigation, briefly state its **current status** (e.g., completed, data analysis in progress, subject recruitment ongoing)
- If preliminary or final results are available, summarise the **main findings and conclusions** related to device safety and performance
- Note that complete clinical investigation reports will be reviewed in detail in the CER

## Summary of PMCF and PMS Data (if applicable)

If the device (or a closely similar predecessor from the same manufacturer) has a sales and use history in any market (including outside the EU):

- **Market application overview**: Regions marketed, approximate sales volumes or clinical use cases, and duration of market use
- **Safety data summary**: Types and numbers of user complaints received, adverse event reports (including severity and frequency), and any related vigilance activities or corrective/preventive actions. A tabular format may be used for large datasets.
- **Completed PMCF studies or activities**: If specific PMCF studies or activities have been completed, summarise their main results

If the device is entirely new with no market history, clearly state that no such data currently exist, while noting that the manufacturer has established PMS and PMCF procedures and plans to collect and analyse relevant data after market launch.

## Positioning Note on Literature Search Data

This section focuses on data "generated and held by the manufacturer." Data obtained through systematic literature searches — including detailed search strategies, database lists, search terms, inclusion/exclusion criteria, screening processes, and quality assessment methods — should be elaborated in the methodology section of the CEP ([Literature Search Protocol](./lsp)).

## Data Availability and Traceability

The CEP should convey a clear message: all manufacturer-generated and held data mentioned have corresponding original records and reports as support, and will be cited, analysed, and assessed in detail in the subsequent CER.
