Within the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP), the “Clinical Development Plan (CDP)” chapter serves as a strategic blueprint, clearly outlining the series of activities planned by the manufacturer to gather and evaluate clinical evidence. This evidence is necessary to demonstrate the conformity of the device under evaluation with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) and to confirm its benefit-risk profile throughout its entire lifecycle. This chapter should present a logically sequenced and phased strategy, progressing from the assessment of existing data, through any necessary new clinical investigations (if required), to post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF). The level of detail should be proportionate to the device’s risk class, novelty, the adequacy of existing knowledge, and relevant regulatory requirements (such as MDR Annex XIV Part A, section 1(a)).

This chapter is essential to demonstrate the manufacturer’s proactive planning and commitment to generating clinical evidence.

## **Defining the Current Stage and Overall Strategy of Clinical Development**

Firstly, the CDP should concisely state the current stage of the device’s clinical development. For instance, it might be a newly designed device seeking initial CE marking, a significant modification of an existing marketed device, or an iteration of a product based on well-established technology. This contextual information directly influences the subsequent strategy for clinical evidence generation.

Building on this, an overview of the general strategy for obtaining and/or generating clinical evidence should be provided. This includes specifying how existing data is planned to be leveraged and, if existing data is insufficient to fully demonstrate safety and performance, how new clinical investigations will be conducted to address these gaps.

## **Plan for Integration and Utilization of Existing Clinical-Relevant Data**

The CDP should detail the plan for systematically collecting, integrating, and evaluating existing clinical-relevant data. These data sources may include:

  * **Preclinical Study Data:** This forms the basis for demonstrating the device’s conformity with its technical specifications and fundamental safety and performance requirements. An overview of key completed preclinical studies (e.g., bench testing, simulated use, animal studies) and how their main conclusions support the initial assessment of clinical safety and performance should be provided.
  * **Existing Published Literature Data:** It should describe the plan for systematically searching, screening, and appraising scientific literature relevant to the device under evaluation itself (if such literature exists), or to similar or equivalent devices with comparable technological characteristics and intended uses. 
  * **Data from Equivalent Devices (if applicable):** If equivalence to one or more equivalent devices has been successfully demonstrated in preceding chapters of the CEP, the CDP should reiterate and elaborate on the plan to utilize clinical data from these equivalent devices (including published literature, post-market data, etc.) to support the clinical evaluation of the device under evaluation.

## **Planning for New Pre-Market Clinical Investigations (if applicable)**

If, after a comprehensive assessment of existing data, it is determined that this data is insufficient to fully cover all clinical claims, address all identified clinical risks, or adequately demonstrate conformity with all relevant GSPRs, then the CDP must clearly articulate any new pre-market clinical investigations planned.

For each planned pre-market clinical investigation, the CDP section of the CEP should provide a summary description (more detailed information is typically contained in dedicated Clinical Investigation Plans (CIPs) and Investigator’s Brochures (IBs)), covering at least:

  * **Rationale and Objectives of the Investigation:** Clearly state the specific questions the investigation aims to answer or the specific safety and/or performance claims it intends to validate.
  * **Overview of Investigation Design:** For example, whether it is an exploratory, feasibility, pivotal, or registry study.
  * **Primary Endpoints:** Outline the main clinical outcomes directly related to the device’s safety and performance claims that are planned for assessment in the investigation.
  * **Target Population and Sample Size Considerations:** Briefly describe the characteristics of the subjects to be enrolled and the basis for estimating the approximate sample size.
  * **Anticipated Timelines and Milestones:** Provide a general schedule for the main phases of the investigation.
  * **Statement of Compliance:** Confirm that the investigation will adhere to applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., MDR), ethical principles, and relevant standards (e.g., ISO 14155).

If, after evaluation, existing data is deemed sufficient to support the pre-market clinical evaluation without the need for new pre-market clinical investigations, the CDP must provide a robust and well-supported justification for this conclusion.

## **Proactive Planning for Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF)**

The CDP must not be limited to pre-market activities; it must demonstrate a vision for clinical data collection that spans the entire lifecycle of the device, in which Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) is an indispensable component. PMCF aims to continuously confirm the device’s clinical safety and performance and to monitor its long-term behavior in real-world use.

In the CDP chapter of the CEP, an outline of the initial PMCF plan and strategic direction should be provided. This should be proportionate to the device’s risks, characteristics, and any uncertainties remaining from the pre-market clinical evaluation. Types of planned PMCF activities that can be mentioned include:

  * Continuous analysis of routine **Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) data** (including user complaints, vigilance reports, trend analysis).
  * Regular systematic **literature reviews and monitoring**.
  * Information gathering through **user feedback surveys, Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs)** , etc.
  * Establishment of or participation in **product registries**.
  * Conducting specific **PMCF studies** (e.g., observational studies, extended cohort studies, or even post-market controlled studies to address specific long-term safety and performance questions, or to further validate performance in different subgroups).

The CDP should articulate the main objectives of PMCF activities, which typically include:

  * Continuously confirming the clinical safety and performance of the device throughout its expected lifetime.
  * Identifying and analyzing any previously unknown potential risks, side-effects, or complications.
  * Monitoring developments in the state-of-the-art (SOTA) relevant to the device.
  * Continuously confirming that the device’s benefit-risk profile remains acceptable.

## **Linking the CDP to Overall Clinical Evaluation Goals**

The entire narrative of the CDP should clearly connect its various planned activities (both pre-market and post-market) to the fundamental goals of the clinical evaluation. That is, how these activities collectively contribute to gathering sufficient clinical evidence to demonstrate conformity with relevant GSPRs, confirm the benefit-risk determination, and scientifically substantiate its clinical claims. Furthermore, the outcomes of the CDP activities will provide crucial input for the ongoing updates of the risk management process and the periodic updates of the Clinical Evaluation Report.
