# Clinical Development Plan (CDP)

In the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP), the "Clinical Development Plan (CDP)" chapter serves as a planning blueprint, clearly outlining the series of clinical evidence collection and assessment activities planned by the manufacturer to demonstrate that the device under evaluation conforms to the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) and to confirm its benefit-risk ratio throughout its lifecycle. This section should present a logically clear, phased strategy — from assessment of existing data to necessary clinical investigations (if required) and post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF). The level of detail should be commensurate with the device's risk class, degree of innovation, sufficiency of existing data, and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., MDR Annex XIV Part A Section 1(a)).

## Current Development Stage and Overall Strategy

First, briefly articulate the current clinical development stage of the device under evaluation (e.g., entirely new design seeking initial CE marking, significant modification of a marketed device, or iterative product based on established technology). This context directly influences the subsequent clinical evidence collection strategy.

Outline the overall strategy for obtaining and/or generating clinical evidence, including how existing data will be utilised and how new clinical investigations will address any gaps when existing data are insufficient.

## Plan for Integrating and Utilising Existing Clinical Data

Describe in detail how existing clinically relevant data will be systematically collected, integrated, and assessed:

- **Preclinical study data**: Outline completed key preclinical studies (bench testing, simulated use, animal studies) and how their main conclusions support the initial assessment of clinical safety and performance
- **Existing published literature data**: Describe how scientific literature related to the device under evaluation itself (if relevant publications exist) or to similar/equivalent devices with comparable technical characteristics and intended use will be systematically searched, screened, and appraised
- **Data from equivalent devices (if applicable)**: If equivalence with one or more equivalent devices has been successfully demonstrated in the preceding CEP sections, reiterate and detail how the clinical data from those equivalent devices (published literature, post-market data, etc.) will be used to support the clinical evaluation

## Planning Pre-Market Clinical Investigations (if applicable)

If comprehensive assessment of existing data reveals that they are insufficient to fully cover all clinical claims, address all identified clinical risks, or adequately demonstrate conformity with all relevant GSPR, the CDP must clearly describe any new pre-market clinical investigations planned.

For each planned pre-market clinical investigation, provide a summary description (more detailed content is typically contained in the Clinical Investigation Plan, CIP, and Investigator's Brochure, IB), covering at minimum:
- **Rationale and objectives**: Clearly state what specific questions the investigation aims to address, or what specific safety and/or performance claims it will validate
- **Study design overview**: e.g., exploratory study, feasibility study, pivotal study, or registry study
- **Primary endpoints**: Key clinical outcomes related to device safety and performance claims
- **Target population and sample size considerations**: Brief description of subject characteristics and rationale for sample size estimation
- **Expected timeline and milestones**: Main scheduling of the investigation plan
- **Compliance statement**: Confirmation that the investigation will comply with applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., MDR), ethical principles, and relevant standards (e.g., ISO 14155)

If existing data are assessed as sufficient to support pre-market clinical evaluation without new pre-market clinical investigations, the CDP must provide adequate and compelling justification for this conclusion.

## Prospective Planning for Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF)

The CDP must not be limited to pre-market activities — it must present a clinical data collection plan covering the entire device lifecycle, of which PMCF is an indispensable component. PMCF aims to continuously confirm the clinical safety and performance of the device and monitor its long-term performance in real-world use.

In the CDP section of the CEP, outline the preliminary PMCF planning and strategic direction, commensurate with the device's risk, characteristics, and any uncertainties remaining at the time of pre-market clinical evaluation. Types of PMCF activities that may be planned include:
- Post-market clinical investigations or studies (e.g., long-term follow-up studies, registry studies)
- Systematic literature reviews (periodic updates)
- Analysis of post-market surveillance data (complaints, vigilance reports, trend reports)
- Patient registries or real-world data collection

The CDP should also indicate the planned frequency of PMCF activities and how the results will feed back into the periodic update of the Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) and the overall risk management file.
