# Clinical Evaluation Services

Clinical evaluation is a critical process for demonstrating that a medical device meets the essential safety and performance principles for its intended use — a mandatory regulatory requirement throughout the entire product lifecycle. Through systematic collection, appraisal, and analysis of clinical data, producing a scientifically rigorous Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) is the cornerstone of successful market access and ongoing compliance.

We provide professional, efficient, and regulation-specific clinical evaluation technical services to medical device manufacturers worldwide, strictly following the latest guidance from China's NMPA and EU MDR (EU) 2017/745. Our services cover all core stages from developing the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP) and conducting systematic literature searches and analyses, to writing the complete CER.
