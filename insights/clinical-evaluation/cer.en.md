# Clinical Evaluation Report (CER)

The Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) is the final output of the clinical evaluation process. It systematically documents the activities carried out according to the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP), the data collected, the analysis performed, and the conclusions reached regarding the medical device's safety, clinical performance, and benefit-risk balance. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the device's conformity with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPR) of EU MDR 2017/745.

## 1. Introduction and Background Review

The opening section of the CER should concisely review the **clinical evaluation objectives, scope, and key device information** established in the CEP:

- **Restatement of objectives and scope**: Reconfirm that this clinical evaluation aims to confirm the device's safety and performance in conformity with MDR GSPR 1 and GSPR 8. Clearly indicate that this CER is the result of executing the specific CEP.
- **Input document list**: List the key documents actually referenced and relied upon during the evaluation (e.g., Risk Management Report, IFU, preclinical study reports, previous versions of CEP/CER).
- **Device description summary**: Accurately describe the device model(s), intended use, classification, and other core information under evaluation.

## 2. Presentation of the Current State of the Art (SOTA)

In the CER, this section **actually presents** the clinical background established by executing the SOTA research plan in the CEP. It should include:
- A summary of the relevant medical condition, existing treatments, alternatives, and the safety and performance levels of similar/benchmark devices
- Applicable standards and guidance documents used as reference in the evaluation

## 3. Reporting Data Collection and Appraisal Results

This is the main body of the CER, reporting in detail the **actual execution and results** of data collection and appraisal according to the CEP plan (particularly the LSP and data appraisal plan):

- **Summary of manufacturer-held data**: Present key results and conclusions of completed preclinical studies (bench testing, biocompatibility, animal studies, etc.). Report design, execution, and key safety and performance data for any manufacturer-sponsored clinical investigations. If the device is already marketed, summarise relevant PMS and PMCF data.
- **Literature search and screening results**: Report in detail the execution of the literature search (databases searched, dates, search strings used, number of records retrieved) and clearly present the screening process and results (numbers included/excluded and reasons) using a PRISMA flowchart or similar.
- **Equivalence demonstration (if applicable)**: Present detailed comparative analysis results with the selected equivalent device(s) across clinical, technical, and biological characteristics, justify the clinical significance of all differences, and conclude whether equivalence is established.
- **Implementation of data appraisal**: Describe how all collected relevant data (literature, clinical investigation, PMS data, etc.) were appraised for relevance, quality, and scientific validity according to the pre-defined criteria and methods in the CEP.

## 4. Integrated Analysis and Conclusions

This is the core analytical section of the CER, integrating all appraised relevant data for comprehensive analysis and conclusions:

- **Safety analysis**: Comprehensively assess the device's safety profile using all data sources (clinical investigations, adverse event reports in literature, safety database information), analyse the nature, incidence, severity, and possible device-relatedness of adverse events, and compare with SOTA. Confirm that the device's safety conforms to GSPR 1.
- **Performance analysis**: Based on clinical investigation data, equivalent device data, or high-quality literature data, assess whether the device achieves its claimed clinical performance indicators and intended use. Compare actual performance data with SOTA or pre-defined acceptance criteria. Confirm that the device's performance conforms to GSPR 1.
- **Benefit-risk analysis**: Based on the integrated assessment of safety and performance, make the critical benefit-risk determination. Clearly articulate the device's main clinical benefits, weigh the identified risks (including residual risks), and with reference to SOTA, demonstrate that the device's overall benefits outweigh its risks and that the benefit-risk ratio is acceptable, in conformity with GSPR 1 and GSPR 8.
- **Acceptability of side effects**: Specifically discuss device-related side effects, assess their nature, incidence, and clinical manageability, and demonstrate their acceptability in the context of clinical benefits, in conformity with GSPR 8.

## 5. Integration with Risk Management Activities

The CER should clearly describe how the results of the clinical evaluation interact with the risk management process. Confirm that the clinical risks identified in the risk management file have been adequately assessed through this clinical evaluation, and that all residual risks are acceptable in the context of clinical benefits. If new risks or changes in understanding of existing risks were identified during the clinical evaluation, describe how this information has been fed back to the risk management system for updating.

## 6. Review of and Outlook for the Clinical Development Plan (CDP)

Briefly review the execution of the CDP established in the CEP, summarising completed activities and their contribution to this clinical evaluation. Also address future CDP activities, particularly the ongoing planning for Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF), to ensure continuous monitoring and confirmation of the device's long-term safety and performance.

## 7. Overall Conclusions

The concluding section of the CER must provide a clear, affirmative **overall conclusion**:
- Summarise that this clinical evaluation has adequately demonstrated the safety, clinical performance, and claimed clinical benefits of the device under evaluation for its intended use
- State that the device conforms to the relevant GSPR under MDR (particularly GSPR 1 and GSPR 8)
- Confirm that the device's benefit-risk ratio is acceptable under the intended conditions of use

## 8. Date of Next Clinical Evaluation

Finally, in accordance with regulatory requirements and device characteristics, specify the next update date or update cycle for this CER.
