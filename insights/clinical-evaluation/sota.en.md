# Clinical Background (State of the Art)

The "Clinical Background (State-of-the-Art, SOTA)" chapter within the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP) is a critical segment for establishing the clinical value and positioning of the medical device under evaluation. The core objective is to systematically and objectively articulate the current body of medical knowledge and standard clinical practices relevant to the device. By clearly defining the associated disease(s), existing diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, alternative treatment options, and their generally accepted levels of safety and performance, the SOTA provides essential benchmarks for the subsequent determination of the clinical evaluation's scope, endpoint selection, and acceptance criteria.

## Clinical Background

This section constructs a clear and comprehensive framework for the specific medical field in which the device will be applied.

**Disease definition and epidemiology**: Precisely define the specific medical condition or disease directly related to the device's intended use, including its definition, epidemiological characteristics (prevalence, incidence, demographic features), primary risk factors, and recognised pathophysiological mechanisms.

**Clinical manifestations**: Detail the spectrum of clinical manifestations, from early or asymptomatic stages through typical signs and symptoms to the most severe clinical phases. Include information on natural history, progression, and overall prognosis.

**Challenges and unmet clinical needs**: Identify and articulate the deficiencies or difficulties that remain in the diagnosis, treatment, or long-term management of the disease under existing care paradigms. This may include diagnostic accuracy issues in specific patient subgroups, lack of standardisation in clinical practice, limitations of existing treatments in improving long-term outcomes, or technical barriers posed by specific pathological changes.

**Existing diagnostic methods and standardised pathways**: Systematically describe current diagnostic techniques, from basic clinical assessment (history and physical examination) through core non-invasive and invasive diagnostic technologies. Reference relevant clinical guidelines (e.g., NICE, ACC/AHA, ESVS) for diagnostic pathway recommendations.

**Mainstream treatment strategies and gold standards**: Describe the recommended treatment strategies for different disease stages, types, or severity levels, including conservative management (lifestyle interventions, risk factor management, pharmacotherapy) and interventional/surgical approaches. Reference authoritative clinical guidelines.

**Clinical endpoints**: Define the industry-recognised clinical endpoints used to assess safety and performance for the clinical application related to the device type, including safety endpoints (peri-procedural complications, long-term adverse events) and performance parameters. Provide representative quantitative data or acceptable ranges from published literature or guidelines where possible.

## Alternative Treatment Options

This section objectively and comprehensively describes other currently available alternative treatment options besides the device under evaluation (or its related therapy).

**Systematic description**: Categorise alternatives as:
- Conservative treatment or non-interventional management
- Other types of interventional or surgical techniques
- Other relevant adjunctive or specialised treatments

**Comparative analysis**: Compare the device under evaluation against these alternatives on recognised key safety and performance clinical endpoints, based on high-quality evidence (published RCTs, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, authoritative clinical guidelines). Maintain neutrality and objectivity — present both potential clinical benefits and any limitations or comparability with established approaches.
