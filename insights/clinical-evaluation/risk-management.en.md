# Risk Management in Clinical Evaluation

In the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP), the "Risk Management" section does not re-execute risk management activities. Its core purpose is to clearly articulate how the risk management process interrelates with and provides input to clinical evaluation activities, jointly ensuring that the benefit-risk ratio of the device under evaluation is acceptable for its intended use. This section should outline the identified clinically relevant risks and how clinical evaluation is planned to further confirm the controllability and acceptability of those risks.

This section should reflect the continuous, bidirectional interaction between risk management and clinical evaluation — a key requirement under MDR.

## Linking to the Existing Risk Management Framework

This section should first confirm that the manufacturer has established and operates a complete risk management process in accordance with applicable standards (e.g., ISO 14971) and MDR requirements. The CEP is developed within this established risk management framework. It should outline how the risk management process has identified clinical risks associated with the device under evaluation. This information typically comes from core risk management documents such as the Risk Management Plan, Hazard Analysis (HA — including use hazard analysis, design hazard analysis, etc.), Process/Manufacturing FMEA (PFMEA), and the final Risk Management Report.

## Identified Risks Relevant to Clinical Evaluation

Following the overview of the risk management framework, the CEP should briefly describe the significant risks associated with the clinical use of the device that have been identified through the risk management activities. This includes an initial assessment of these risks (both initial risks and residual risks after risk control measures), and how their acceptability has been determined against the criteria pre-defined in the Risk Management Plan.

It should also describe how the risk control measures already implemented — such as conformity with harmonised standards, specification of device service life, maintenance requirements, and provision of safe use information through labelling and instructions for use — are aimed at reducing these risks to a level that is as far as possible (AFAP).

## Role of Clinical Evaluation in Confirming Acceptability of Residual Risks

The CEP must clearly articulate that one of the core roles of clinical evaluation (and one of the primary activities planned in the CEP) is to collect and analyse clinical data to further confirm the acceptability of the identified residual risks, in the context of the benefits provided by the device and with reference to the current state of the art (SOTA). Clinical evaluation will pay particular attention to the actual incidence rates of these residual risks, the severity of their clinical manifestation, and their specific impact in real-world clinical use.

## Planned Data Sources for Assessing Clinical Risks

To achieve the above objectives, the CEP should outline the types of data planned to be collected and analysed to assess and confirm clinical risks. This should align with the overall data collection strategy of the clinical evaluation. Possible data sources include:

- Data from **preclinical studies**, particularly test results validating and verifying that the device design conforms to relevant safety standards (e.g., harmonised standards)
- Published **clinical data** on the device under evaluation or comparable similar/equivalent devices
- **Post-market surveillance (PMS) data** from the device under evaluation or similar/equivalent devices, including user complaints, vigilance system reports, and trend reports
- If **clinical investigations** are planned or ongoing, clinical data obtained from these are also core evidence for risk assessment

## Ensuring Consistency and Dynamic Risk Management Updates

The CEP should emphasise that risk management and clinical evaluation are not one-time activities but ongoing processes throughout the device lifecycle. As clinical evaluation progresses and new clinical data are collected, the risk management file may need to be updated accordingly. Conversely, any changes to the risk management file (e.g., identification of new hazards, updates to risk control measures) should be reflected in the clinical evaluation.

This dynamic update mechanism ensures that the device's benefit-risk assessment always reflects the latest available evidence and the current state of the art, thereby meeting the continuous compliance requirements of MDR.
