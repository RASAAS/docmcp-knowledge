# Literature Search Protocol (LSP)

Within the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP), a clear and systematic description of the literature search planning and methodology is essential. Whether outlined in the CEP body and detailed in an appendix, or presented as a standalone chapter, the core purpose is to pre-define a scientific, rigorous, and reproducible process for comprehensively and objectively identifying and retrieving published scientific literature and safety data relevant to the device under evaluation. A well-designed LSP is the key safeguard for ensuring that the external evidence underpinning the clinical evaluation is both sufficient and unbiased.

The LSP section should clearly outline the complete strategy from search objective setting to final literature screening.

## Defining Search Objectives and Scope

Clearly articulate the core objectives of the literature search, which typically include:
- Establishing the **current State-of-the-Art (SOTA)** for the relevant medical field, specific clinical condition, and related treatment technologies
- Collecting **clinical data, safety, and performance information** on the device under evaluation (if published studies or reports exist)
- Identifying and retrieving **clinical data on similar devices, benchmark devices, or identified equivalent devices** for comparative analysis or to support equivalence claims
- Collecting information on potential **clinical hazards, adverse events, complications**, and known risks associated with the device type or technology

After defining the objectives, delineate the **scope** of the search: time span (e.g., past 5 or 10 years, or a specific window based on technology development pace), language (typically English), and any specific device characteristics, clinical application scenarios, or patient subgroups of particular focus.

## Formulating Research Questions

Pre-defining clear **research questions** is an indispensable step for making the literature search more targeted and effective. These questions should derive from the core objectives of the clinical evaluation, the device's intended use, key clinical claims, and any uncertainties or information gaps identified during risk assessment or existing data review.

Research questions may be organised around different themes:
- **SOTA research questions**: aimed at comprehensively understanding the current treatment landscape, mainstream technologies, alternative therapies, and their respective clinical safety and performance profiles
- **Device-specific research questions**: focused on collecting directly relevant clinical evidence to assess the specific safety and performance of the device under evaluation, similar/equivalent/benchmark devices, or for cross-comparison

## Developing the Search Strategy

The search strategy is the core of the LSP, specifying in detail how information will be systematically retrieved.

**Selection of data sources**: Specify which types of databases and information sources will be searched. See: [Literature Databases and Justification](./lit-database) and [Clinical Data Analysis](./clinical-data-analysis).

**Search term and search string construction**:
- *Preliminary information gathering*: Before constructing complex database search strings, broad preliminary research is helpful to understand the disease background, current clinical practice, authoritative guideline recommendations, key safety and performance evaluation indicators, and unmet medical needs
- *Core search term selection and combination*: Systematically build keyword lists around device characteristics (generic name, technical principle, key components), intended use (related diseases, indications, surgical procedures), target population, clinical outcomes of interest (safety, performance, efficacy indicators), and comparators (trade names and generic names of similar/equivalent devices)
- *Search logic*: Describe how Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), truncation, wildcards, and field restrictions (title, abstract, keyword fields) will be used to combine keywords and construct database-specific search strings
- *Strategy adjustments for different search objectives*: SOTA, device-specific, and similar/equivalent/benchmark device searches may require different keyword emphases and combinations

**Application of search limits**: Specify whether and how search limits will be applied (publication date range, language, study type). Note that over-reliance on study type filters for safety-related information may miss important signals from non-traditional studies (case reports, adverse event databases) — use with careful consideration.

## Defining Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Clearly define the **inclusion and exclusion criteria** that will be applied during literature screening. These criteria are the operational standards for determining which retrieved records will be included in the clinical evaluation.

**Inclusion criteria** typically include: peer-reviewed published literature, literature in specified languages (usually English), literature containing relevant clinical data on the device under evaluation or comparator devices.

**Exclusion criteria** typically include: in vitro, preclinical, laboratory studies (including animal in vivo studies); narrative reviews, abstracts, case reports, published article comments; literature without quantitative outcome data; duplicate studies.

## Describing the Screening Process

Describe the planned **literature screening process**, typically a two-stage approach: initial screening (title and abstract reading) followed by full-text review. Specify the criteria applied at each stage and how screening decisions will be documented and justified.

## Data Appraisal and Analysis Methods

Briefly describe the planned **data appraisal and analysis methods** to be applied to the included literature. Reference the suitability and contribution assessment criteria described in [Literature Appraisal Criteria](./lit-review-standard).
