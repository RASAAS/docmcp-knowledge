# Data Collection Report (DCR)

The Data Collection Report (DCR) is a key document in the clinical evaluation process that systematically records and summarises the detailed process and direct outputs of data retrieval activities conducted according to a pre-defined protocol (typically the Literature Search Protocol, LSP, within the CEP). The core purpose of the DCR is to provide a transparent, traceable, and auditable record of raw data collection results for subsequent data appraisal, analysis, and CER writing.

## 1. Purpose, Scope, and Basic Information

Clearly articulate the purpose and scope of the DCR: documenting the collection, screening, and preliminary assessment of publicly available data (primarily from scientific clinical literature and safety databases) for the safety and performance evaluation of the specific device under evaluation (briefly list key device identification information: generic name, intended use, indications, target patient population). State that the data collection activities were conducted strictly in accordance with the LSP previously established in the CEP.

## 2. Databases Searched, Time Frames, and Any Deviations from Plan

Document in detail the databases actually searched and their defined search time frames, separately listing:
- Databases for scientific clinical literature (e.g., PubMed, Embase)
- Databases for safety information (e.g., FDA MAUDE, Swissmedic, BfArM, MHRA, TGA)

For different search types (e.g., SOTA search, device-specific search), clearly state the defined time spans and their rationale (e.g., SOTA search limited to the past 5 years; safety database search with no time limit to capture all relevant events).

Any deviations from the original LSP during actual execution, and their rationale, must be explicitly documented. If there are no deviations, this should be clearly stated.

## 3. Confirmation of Search and Screening Criteria

Confirm or briefly restate the core inclusion and exclusion criteria strictly applied during the actual screening process (e.g., peer-reviewed published studies only, specific language restrictions, exclusion of in vitro studies, animal studies, conference abstracts, narrative reviews).

## 4. Brief Description of Preliminary Data Assessment Methods

Briefly describe the data assessment methods used during the screening and preliminary organisation phase, including criteria for assessing relevance (device match, application match, patient population match, reporting quality) and scientific quality. Describe how these criteria were consistently applied to all identified literature and any pre-defined inclusion thresholds.

## 5. Quantitative Results of Literature Search

Present the specific results of the scientific literature search in a clear, structured manner:
- **Search details per database**: For each database, list the complete search strings used and the number of records retrieved
- **Screening flow summary**: Total records retrieved from all databases, number after deduplication, and numbers included/excluded after title/abstract screening and full-text review
- A **PRISMA flowchart** or similar diagram is strongly recommended to visually present the complete screening pathway, including the number and primary reasons for exclusion at each stage

## 6. Safety Database Search Results

Present the results of the safety database searches, including the number of adverse event records, recall records, or field safety corrective action records retrieved from each database, and a brief description of the types and nature of the records identified.

## 7. Summary Table of Included Literature

Provide a summary table of all literature ultimately included in the clinical evaluation, typically including: study ID, first author, year of publication, study design, device studied, key findings (safety and performance), and relevance assessment score.

## 8. Conclusions

Briefly summarise the overall results of the data collection activities, including the total number of included studies, the main types of evidence, and any notable observations or limitations identified during the data collection process that may affect the subsequent clinical evaluation.
