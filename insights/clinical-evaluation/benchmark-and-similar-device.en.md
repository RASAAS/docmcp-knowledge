# Benchmark or Similar Devices

In the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP), the "Benchmark or Similar Devices" chapter provides a crucial frame of reference for the clinical evaluation by identifying and describing existing devices on the market that are comparable to the device under evaluation. The purpose is to delineate the landscape of products that are similar or can serve as benchmarks in terms of design, intended use, or technological characteristics within the current state of the art. This facilitates understanding of the technological positioning of the device under evaluation and provides a basis for subsequent equivalence demonstrations (if applicable), the establishment of performance and safety acceptance criteria, and the benefit-risk analysis.

## Criteria for Selecting Benchmark or Similar Devices

Selection should be based on clear and justified criteria. Priority should be given to products with significant relevance in one or more of the following areas:

- **Intended use and indications**: Products with highly consistent or very similar intended use, target patient population, and clinical application scenarios
- **Technical characteristics and mechanism of action**: Products using similar technical principles, key design features, or mechanisms of action
- **Materials and construction**: For material-dependent devices, similarity in primary materials is an important consideration
- **Market representativeness and recognition**: Products with a good application history in the target market (especially the EU), widely accepted clinically, or representing mature technologies in the current state of the art
- **Regulatory status**: Typically products with CE marking (under MDR or MDD) or cleared/approved in other major regulatory jurisdictions (e.g., FDA)
- **Equivalence demonstration needs**: If clinical evaluation is planned via the equivalence pathway with a marketed device, that "equivalent device" will be subject to detailed comparative analysis in the corresponding section

## Describing Selected Benchmark or Similar Devices

For each selected benchmark or similar device, provide a concise and informative description. The key is to extract and present the information most critical for understanding the product's characteristics and its comparability with the device under evaluation:

**Product identification**: Clearly state the accurate product name, model (if applicable), and manufacturer. Briefly describe its regulatory status in major markets (e.g., CE marking and applicable regulation MDR/MDD, or FDA clearance/approval status).

**Intended use and indications**: Describe the intended use and indications — this directly relates to clinical comparability with the device under evaluation.

**Key design and technical characteristics**: Tailor this to the device type:
- For active devices: operating principle, key performance parameters (e.g., energy output range, frequency)
- For passive implants: primary structural materials, surface treatment, mechanical performance indicators
- For IVDs: detection principle, sample type, key analytical performance (sensitivity, specificity)

**Known safety and performance profile**: If summary information on the known safety and performance profile is available from public sources (product IFU, manufacturer website, published literature, regulatory databases) and is substantively relevant to subsequent comparative analysis, briefly mention it (e.g., known clinical application outcomes, major complication rates).

## Articulating Relevance to the Device Under Evaluation

After describing each benchmark or similar device, articulate why it was selected and its specific relevance to the device undergoing clinical evaluation. For example: Is it the basis for an equivalence demonstration ("equivalent device")? Does it represent the mainstream technology level of similar products currently on the market? Or is it selected because a specific design or performance feature is highly comparable to the device under evaluation?

## Organisation and Presentation

A tabular format comparing core characteristics across multiple benchmark or similar devices can make information clear at a glance. After introducing each product individually, a brief summary paragraph can distil the commonalities, differences, and implications for evaluating the device under evaluation.
