# Data Appraisal and Analysis

In the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP), the "Data Appraisal and Analysis" section is the core methodological component. It aims to clearly and systematically plan how all relevant data related to the device under evaluation will be identified, how these data will be rigorously appraised for suitability, quality, and scientific validity, and how the appraised data will ultimately be comprehensively analysed to reach conclusions on the device's safety, performance, and benefit-risk ratio. The plan and methods described in this section are key to ensuring that the entire clinical evaluation process is scientific, objective, reproducible, and compliant with regulatory requirements.

## Defining the Scope of "Pertinent Data" and Identification Strategy

The CEP must clearly define what data are considered "pertinent data" for this clinical evaluation — closely aligned with the clinical evaluation scope, device characteristics, intended use, and specific claims that need to be supported by clinical evidence.

Briefly reiterate the main sources from which these pertinent data will be obtained:
- Preclinical data generated and held by the manufacturer (bench testing, animal studies, biocompatibility data, etc.)
- Published scientific literature on the device under evaluation or equivalent/similar devices
- Manufacturer-sponsored clinical investigation data (if any)
- Post-market surveillance (PMS) and post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) data
- Clinical data from equivalent devices (if applicable)
- Outputs from the risk management process

Outline the specific strategies and methods for identifying all these pertinent data, particularly for literature data (systematic literature search and screening methods). Clear **inclusion and exclusion criteria** are essential for ensuring objectivity and consistency in data selection.

## Planning the Data Appraisal Process

Data appraisal is one of the core steps of clinical evaluation, aimed at judging the quality of identified data and their contribution to evaluation conclusions.

**Pre-defined appraisal criteria**: Emphasise that a pre-defined, objective set of appraisal criteria will be used to systematically evaluate all collected data. These criteria should ensure transparency and consistency of the appraisal process and minimise bias. Appraisal criteria typically cover:

- **Relevance**: Whether the data directly relate to the device under evaluation (or its equivalent/similar devices), its intended use, target population, and the specific safety and performance endpoints to be evaluated
- **Quality and methodological soundness**: In-depth examination of the data generation methods, including study design (RCT, observational study, case series, etc.), implementation process, completeness of data collection, appropriateness of statistical analysis, potential sources of bias (selection bias, information bias, confounders), impact of random error, and adequacy of disclosure
- **Contribution to demonstration of conformity**: Based on data relevance and quality, judge its weight and value in demonstrating device safety and performance

**Uniform application of appraisal criteria**: These pre-defined criteria will be uniformly applied to all data sources (manufacturer-held data, literature data, clinical investigation data, etc.), and both positive (supportive) and negative (non-supportive or risk-indicating) data will be given equal weight in objective appraisal.

**Differentiated use of data**: Recognise that not all data are equally applicable to all evaluation purposes. For example, data from studies with design limitations that are insufficient to demonstrate device performance may still contain information valuable for safety analysis, and vice versa.

## Planning the Data Analysis Strategy

After data have been rigorously appraised and deemed applicable, the CEP must plan how these data will be comprehensively analysed to form overall conclusions on device safety, performance, and benefit-risk.

**Evidence synthesis and integration**: Describe how appraised evidence from different sources (preclinical, clinical investigations, literature, PMS, etc.) will be systematically integrated and synthesised to build a comprehensive, coherent body of evidence.

**Safety analysis plan**: Outline how all relevant safety data will be comprehensively analysed, including the nature, incidence, severity, and device-relatedness of adverse events, and how these will be compared with SOTA safety benchmarks.

**Performance analysis plan**: Describe how device performance data will be analysed to assess whether the device achieves its claimed clinical performance indicators, and how these will be compared with SOTA performance benchmarks or pre-defined acceptance criteria.

**Benefit-risk analysis plan**: Describe how the benefit-risk determination will be made based on the integrated safety and performance analysis, with reference to SOTA and current clinical practice, to demonstrate that the device's overall benefits outweigh its risks and that the benefit-risk ratio is acceptable.

**Handling of conflicting data**: Describe how conflicting or inconsistent data from different sources will be handled, including how discrepancies will be identified, analysed, and resolved or explained.
