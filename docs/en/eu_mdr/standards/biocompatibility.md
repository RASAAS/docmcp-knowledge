# Harmonised Standards — Biocompatibility

**Official Source**: [EC Health — Harmonised Standards](https://health.ec.europa.eu/medical-devices-topics-interest/harmonised-standards_en) | Based on CID (EU) 2021/1182 (consolidated) and amendment [CID (EU) 2026/193](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2026/193/oj)

## Harmonised Standards List (9 standards)

| Standard | Title Summary | GSPR Reference | Status |
|----------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **EN ISO 10993-4:2017 + A1:2025** | Part 4: Selection of tests for interactions with blood | GSPR 10.4 (blood compatibility) | Current |
| **EN ISO 10993-9:2021** | Part 9: Framework for identification and quantification of potential degradation products | GSPR 10.4 (chemical safety) | Current |
| **EN ISO 10993-10:2023** | Part 10: Tests for skin sensitisation | GSPR 10.4 (sensitisation) | Current |
| **EN ISO 10993-12:2021** | Part 12: Sample preparation and reference materials | GSPR 10.4 (biological evaluation methods) | Current |
| **EN ISO 10993-15:2023** | Part 15: Identification and quantification of degradation products from metals and alloys | GSPR 10.4 (chemical safety) | Current |
| **EN ISO 10993-17:2023** | Part 17: Toxicological risk assessment of medical device constituents | GSPR 10.4 (toxicological safety) | Current |
| **EN ISO 10993-18:2020 + A1:2023** | Part 18: Chemical characterization within a risk management process | GSPR 10.4 (chemical characterisation) | Current |
| **EN ISO 10993-23:2021** | Part 23: Tests for irritation | GSPR 10.4 (irritation) | Current |
| **EN 455-3:2023** | Medical gloves for single use — Part 3: Biological evaluation | GSPR 10.4 (glove biocompatibility) | Current |

> **Important**: The following widely-used standards are **not** on the EU MDR harmonised standards list and do not create a presumption of conformity: EN ISO 10993-1 (evaluation framework), EN ISO 10993-3 (genotoxicity), EN ISO 10993-5 (cytotoxicity), EN ISO 10993-6 (implantation), EN ISO 10993-7 (EO residuals), EN ISO 10993-11 (systemic toxicity), EN ISO 10993-13 (polymers). They remain industry-accepted evaluation methods but must be justified separately in the technical file.

## Biocompatibility Evaluation Framework

Material characterisation → Hazard identification → Exposure assessment → Toxicological risk assessment → Biocompatibility conclusion

Under EU MDR, **chemical characterisation takes priority**: toxicological risk assessment (TRA) is performed first; animal testing is only conducted when TRA is insufficient to reach a conclusion.
