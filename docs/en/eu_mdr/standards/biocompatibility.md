## Biocompatibility Evaluation Framework (Based on ISO 10993-1:2018)

Material characterisation → Hazard identification → Exposure assessment → Toxicological risk assessment → Biocompatibility conclusion

Under EU MDR, **chemical characterisation takes priority**: toxicological risk assessment (TRA) is performed first; animal testing is only conducted when TRA is insufficient to reach a conclusion.
