# Software & Usability — EU MDR Related Standards

**Official Source**: [EC Health — Harmonised Standards](https://health.ec.europa.eu/medical-devices-topics-interest/harmonised-standards_en) | Based on CID (EU) 2021/1182 (consolidated) and amendment [CID (EU) 2026/193](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2026/193/oj)

## Widely-Used Standards (Non-Harmonised)

| Standard | Title Summary | GSPR Reference | Status |
|----------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **EN IEC 62304:2006+A1:2015** | Software life cycle processes | GSPR 17, 5 (Software & usability) | Widely used (non-harmonised) |
| **EN IEC 62366-1:2015+A1:2020** | Application of usability engineering to medical devices | GSPR 17, 5 (Software & usability) | Widely used (non-harmonised) |

> **Important**: EN IEC 62304 and EN IEC 62366-1 are **not** on the EU MDR harmonised standards list (CID 2021/1182). They do not create a presumption of conformity, but are industry-accepted methods for demonstrating GSPR 17 (software) and GSPR 5 (usability) compliance and must be justified as "other methods" in the technical file.

## EN IEC 62304 — Software Safety Classification

| Safety Class | Definition | Requirements Level |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Class A** | No contribution to hazardous situation | Basic requirements |
| **Class B** | Non-serious injury possible | Moderate requirements |
| **Class C** | Death or serious injury possible | Full requirements |

## EN IEC 62366-1 — Usability Engineering Process

1. Use specification: users, use environment, user interface
2. User interface specification: UI design requirements
3. Summative usability evaluation: testing with representative users
4. Usability engineering summary report
