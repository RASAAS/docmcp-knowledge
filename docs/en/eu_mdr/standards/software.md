# Software and Usability — Standards for EU MDR

**Official Source**: [EC Health — Harmonised Standards](https://health.ec.europa.eu/medical-devices-topics-interest/harmonised-standards_en) | Based on CID (EU) 2021/1182 (consolidated) and amendment [CID (EU) 2026/193](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2026/193/oj)

> **Important**: EN IEC 62304 and EN IEC 62366-1 are **not** on the EU MDR harmonised standards list (CID 2021/1182). They do not create a presumption of conformity under EU MDR Article 8. However, they are universally recognised as the appropriate methods for demonstrating compliance with GSPR 17 (software) and GSPR 5 (usability) and must be justified as "other methods" in the technical file.

## Widely Applied Standards (Not Harmonised)

| Standard | Title | GSPR Reference | Status |
|----------|-------|---------------|--------|
| **EN IEC 62304:2006+A1:2015** | Medical device software — Software life cycle processes | GSPR 17 | Widely applied (not harmonised) |
| **EN IEC 62366-1:2015+A1:2020** | Medical devices — Application of usability engineering to medical devices | GSPR 5 | Widely applied (not harmonised) |

## EN IEC 62304 — Software Safety Classification

| Safety Class | Definition | Requirement Level |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| **Class A** | Software failure cannot lead to injury | Basic requirements |
| **Class B** | Software failure can lead to non-serious injury | Intermediate requirements |
| **Class C** | Software failure can lead to death or serious injury | Full requirements |

## EN IEC 62366-1 — Usability Engineering Process

1. Specification of intended use: users, use environment, user interface
2. User interface specification: user interface design requirements
3. Summative usability evaluation: testing with representative users
4. Usability summary report
