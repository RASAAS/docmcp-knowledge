# Harmonised Standards — Electrical Safety and EMC

**Official Source**: [EC Health — Harmonised Standards](https://health.ec.europa.eu/medical-devices-topics-interest/harmonised-standards_en) | Based on CID (EU) 2021/1182 (consolidated) and amendment [CID (EU) 2026/193](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2026/193/oj)

## Harmonised Standards List (1 standard)

| Standard | Title Summary | GSPR Reference | Status |
|----------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **EN IEC 60601-2-83:2020 + A11:2021** | Medical electrical equipment — Part 2-83: Particular requirements for the basic safety and essential performance of home light therapy equipment | GSPR 9 (electrical safety), GSPR 14 (EMC) | Current |

> **Important**: The widely-used EN IEC 60601-1 series (general requirements, EMC, usability, alarm systems, etc.) is **not** on the EU MDR harmonised standards list. These standards do not create a presumption of conformity under EU MDR Article 8, but remain the industry standard for demonstrating GSPR 9 and GSPR 14 compliance. They must be justified as "other methods" in the technical file.

## Note on EN IEC 60601-1 Series

Although not harmonised under EU MDR, the following standards are widely applied in practice:

| Standard | Scope | GSPR Reference |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| EN IEC 60601-1:2006+A1:2013+A2:2021 | General requirements for basic safety and essential performance | GSPR 9, 14 |
| EN IEC 60601-1-2:2015+A1:2021 | Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) | GSPR 14 |
| EN IEC 60601-1-6:2010+A1:2015+A2:2020 | Usability | GSPR 5 |
| EN IEC 60601-1-8:2007+A1:2013+A2:2021 | Alarm systems | GSPR 14 |
| EN IEC 60601-1-11:2015+A1:2020 | Home healthcare environments | GSPR 14 |
| EN IEC 60601-1-12:2014+A1:2020 | Emergency medical services environments | GSPR 14 |
