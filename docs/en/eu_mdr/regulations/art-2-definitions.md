## Key Concepts Interpretation

### Core Elements of "Medical Device" Definition

1. **Intended Purpose**: Declared by the manufacturer in the label/instructions for use/promotional material.
2. **Mechanism of Action**: The principal intended action is **not** achieved by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means (otherwise it is a medicinal product).
3. **Target**: Intended to be used for human beings for medical purposes such as diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, or treatment.

### Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)

Software can constitute a medical device, provided that:
- It has a medical purpose (diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, etc.).
- The principal action is not achieved by pharmacological/immunological/metabolic means.

See [MDCG 2019-11: Guidance on Qualification and Classification of Software](https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/f1a4e0a5-6c3c-4e9d-a6e3-5e7e9a6e8e9f_en?filename=md_mdcg_2019_11_guidance_qualification_classification_software_en_0.pdf)

### Extension of "Manufacturer" Definition

The following scenarios are also considered as acting as a manufacturer:
- Persons who assemble, package, process, fully refurbish or label one or more ready-made products, or assign to them their own intended purpose as a device.
- Persons who modify the intended purpose of a device already placed on the market or put into service.
- Persons who place a device on the market under their own name.
