See [MDCG 2024-15: Guidance on Publication of the Clinical Investigation Report](https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/0e076d19-62dc-4ff9-83f2-be6072a45993_en?filename=mdcg_2024-15_en.pdf)

## Exemptions from Clinical Investigations (Article 61(4)-(6))

Clinical investigations may be exempted under the following circumstances:
- **Article 61(4)**: The device is demonstrated to be equivalent to an already marketed device, and the technical documentation of the equivalent device is accessible.
- **Article 61(5)**: The device has no medical purpose, or is only used for measurement, and there is no scientific justification for conducting a clinical investigation.
- **Article 61(6)**: Implantable and Class III devices are generally required to undergo clinical investigations, except in cases where:
  - The device has been designed by modifying a device already marketed by the same manufacturer, and the modifications do not adversely affect the benefit-risk ratio.
  - The modified device is demonstrated to be equivalent to the marketed device.
  - The clinical evaluation of the marketed device is sufficient to demonstrate conformity of the modified device.

See [MDCG 2023-7: Guidance on exemptions from the requirement to perform clinical investigations](https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/1b5f9cc0-cea0-4459-921f-eaf4b4f80983_en?filename=mdcg_2023-7_en.pdf)
