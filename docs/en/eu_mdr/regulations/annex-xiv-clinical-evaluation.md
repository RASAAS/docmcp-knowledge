### Clinical Evaluation Requirements (Article 61)

Manufacturers shall conduct a clinical evaluation to confirm that:
- The device conforms to the relevant requirements of [Annex I GSPR](./annex-i-gspr)
- The intended benefits of the device outweigh the risks

### Clinical Evaluation Pathways

**Pathway 1 — Clinical Data (preferred)**:
- Clinical investigation data from the manufacturer's own device
- Literature review (scientific literature search)
- Clinical data from an equivalent device (equivalence must be demonstrated)

**Pathway 2 — Equivalent Device**:
- Technical, biological and clinical equivalence with the equivalent device must be demonstrated
- For Class III and implantable devices, a contract with the equivalent device manufacturer must be in place to obtain access to technical documentation

### Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) Content

1. **Scope definition**: device description, intended purpose, target patient population
2. **Clinical background**: clinical context of the disease/condition, existing treatment options
3. **Literature search strategy**: databases searched, keywords, inclusion/exclusion criteria
4. **Literature appraisal**: literature quality assessment, data extraction
5. **Clinical data analysis**: safety and performance data summary
6. **GSPR conformity**: support of clinical data for GSPR
7. **Benefit-risk analysis**: benefit-risk assessment based on clinical data
8. **Conclusions**: clinical evaluation conclusions
9. **Reference to PMCF plan**

### Clinical Evaluation Updates

- CER shall be updated periodically (at minimum in sync with PSUR)
- For Class III and implantable devices: the notified body shall review the CER

## Part B — Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF)

### PMCF Plan Content

- General objectives and rationale for PMCF activities
- Specific methods and procedures (PMCF studies, questionnaires, literature reviews, etc.)
- Reference to relevant harmonised standards ([EN ISO 14155](../standards/clinical-investigation))
- Timeline

### PMCF Report

- PMCF report shall be incorporated into CER updates
- Shall describe the results of PMCF activities and their impact on CER conclusions
