# MDCG 2023-7: Guidance on Exemptions from Clinical Investigations and Sufficient Access to Data for Equivalence

**Document**: MDCG 2023-7  
**Year**: 2023  
**Regulation**: EU MDR 2017/745  
**Official PDF**: [Download](https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/1b5f9cc0-cea0-4459-921f-eaf4b4f80983_en?filename=mdcg_2023-7_en.pdf)

## Purpose

Guidance on conditions for exemption from clinical investigations under Article 61(4)-(6) MDR and on sufficient data access for equivalence claims.

## Key Points

- Article 61(4): exemption where clinical data from equivalent device is sufficient.
- Article 61(5): Class III/implantable devices require contract for access to equivalent device's technical documentation.
- **'Sufficient access'** means verifying completeness and accuracy of clinical data, not just published literature.
- Generic literature reviews are generally insufficient for Class III/implantable devices.

### 2.  Introduction

For ease of reference, the text of Article 61 paragraphs (4)-(6) is included below:

## Article 61 Clinical evaluation

4. In the case of implantable devices and class III devices, clinical investigations shall be performed, except if:
2. the device has been designed by modifications of a device already marketed by the same manufacturer,
3. the  modified  device  has  been  demonstrated  by  the  manufacturer  to  be equivalent to the marketed device, in accordance with Section 3 of Annex XIV and this demonstration has been endorsed by the notified body, and
4. the  clinical  evaluation  of  the  marketed  device  is  sufficient  to  demonstrate conformity  of  the  modified  device  with  the  relevant  safety  and  performance requirements.

In  this  case,  the  notified  body  shall  check  that  the  PMCF  plan  is  appropriate  and includes post market studies to demonstrate the safety and performance of the device. In addition, clinical investigations need not be performed in the cases referred to in paragraph 6.

5. A manufacturer of a device demonstrated to be equivalent to an already marketed device not manufactured by him, may also rely on paragraph 4 in order not to perform a clinical investigation provided that the following conditions are fulfilled in addition to what is required in that paragraph:
2. the  two  manufacturers  have  a  contract  in  place  that  explicitly  allows  the manufacturer of the second device full access to the technical documentation on an ongoing basis, and
3. the  original  clinical  evaluation  has  been  performed  in  compliance  with  the requirements  of  this  Regulation,  and  the  manufacturer  of  the  second  device provides clear evidence thereof to the notified body.
6. The requirement to perform clinical investigations pursuant to paragraph 4 shall not apply to implantable devices and class III devices:
5. (a) which have been lawfully placed on the market or put into service in accordance with  Directive  90/385/EEC  or  Directive  93/42/EEC  and  for  which  the  clinical evaluation:
-   is based on sufficient clinical data, and

-   is  in  compliance  with  the  relevant  product-specific  CS  for  the  clinical evaluation of that kind of device, where such a CS is available; or
- (b) that  are  sutures,  staples,  dental  fillings,  dental  braces,  tooth  crowns,  screws, wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips or connectors for which the clinical evaluation is based on sufficient clinical data and is in compliance with the relevant productspecific CS, where such a CS is available.

Article 61(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) requires clinical investigations to be performed for implantable and class III devices, except in four specific cases as outlined in:

CASE 1)  indents 1-3 of Article 61(4);

CASE 2)  Article 61(6)(a);

CASE 3)  Article 61(6)(b);

CASE 4)  Article 61(5).

These  four  cases  which  are  exempted  from  the  requirement  to  perform  clinical investigations are independent of each other; i.e. the criteria outlined in one paragraph do not apply to the other paragraphs unless directly referenced.

One important consequence of this independence of cases is that the requirement for a contract, pursuant to Article 61(5), does not apply to the cases outlined in indents 13  of  Article  61(4),  Article  61(6)(a)  and  Article  61(6)(b).  For  these  cases,  it  is  only necessary to demonstrate equivalence in accordance with the criteria listed in Annex XIV  Section  3  MDR  to  be  able  to  use  the  associated  clinical  data  in  the  clinical evaluation.

In addition to outlining the technical, biological and clinical characteristics to be taken into  consideration  for  the  demonstration  of  equivalence,  Annex  XIV  Section  3 mandates that 'It shall be clearly demonstrated that manufacturers have sufficient levels  of  access  to  the  data  relating  to  devices  with  which  they  are  claiming equivalence in order to justify their claims of equivalence'. The requirement to have sufficient levels of access to the data required to establish equivalence does not in itself require a contract between the two manufacturers (see Section 5 of this guidance for further detail).

### 3.  Scope

This guidance is intended to clarify the exemptions from the requirement to perform clinical  investigations,  and  associated  conditions  related  to  the  demonstration  of equivalence,  for  implantable  and  class  III  medical  devices  to  be  placed  on  the European  market.  It  also  provides  examples  and  considerations  relevant  to  the demonstration of 'sufficient levels of access to the data' per Annex XIV Section 3.

### 4.  When are clinical investigations not mandatory according to Article 61(4)-(6) of the MDR?

Article 61(4) states that clinical investigations shall be performed for implantable and class  III  devices.  Indents  1-3  of  Article  61(4)  outline  the  first  case  which  can  be exempted from this requirement. Articles 61(5) and 61(6) outline additional exemption cases,  as  illustrated  in  Appendix  I.  Appendix  I  shows  the  parallel  nature,  and  thus independence, of these cases. The conditions that apply to each case are summarised in Table 1 in this section.

N.B. : Devices which are neither class III nor implantable are outside the scope of this document. The need for a clinical investigation(s) for such devices is determined by the objectives of the clinical evaluation and the sufficiency of existing clinical evidence to meet those objectives. Please refer to MDCG 2020-5 and MDCG 2020-6 for further guidance.

The  beginning  of  the  first  sentence  of  Article  61(4)  provides  the  general  obligation, namely 'in the case of implantable devices and class III devices, clinical investigations shall be performed'. The remainder of Article 61(4), as well as Article 61(5) and 61(6) describe circumstances under which these devices are exempted from the requirement to  conduct  clinical  investigations;  they  do  not  describe  conditions  for  demonstrating equivalence,  nor  do  they  describe  when  data  from  EDs  may  be  used  in  a  clinical evaluation.

As summarised in the Introduction to this guidance, the cases in which implantable and class III devices are exempted from mandatory clinical investigations are independent of each other, except where a dependence is explicitly indicated 1, 2 . In other words, the criteria outlined in one paragraph do not apply to the other paragraphs unless directly referenced. Specifically, the requirement for a contract as described in Article 61(5) does not apply to the exemption cases outlined in Articles 61(4) and 61(6).

A manufacturer may use clinical data generated from another manufacturer's ED in the clinical evaluation of the DUE, without a contract, in any of the cases 1 to 3 3 . The only requirement  in  this  respect  is  that  the  equivalence  criteria  described  in  Annex  XIV Section 3 are met.

Use of ED data may enable a manufacturer to demonstrate that their clinical evaluation is based on 'sufficient clinical data'. However the manufacturer is only exempted from the requirement to perform clinical investigations if the conditions outlined in the relevant exemption case are met, as summarised in Table 1 below.

Article 61(5) states 'a manufacturer […] may also rely on paragraph 4 in order not to perform a clinical investigation provided that the following conditions are fulfilled in addition to what is required in that paragraph'. This indicates that the exemption case outlined in Article 61(5) is dependent on criteria described in Article 61(4) being met. In  legal terms, the phrasing 'may also rely upon' indicates a dependence on the referenced paragraph; Article 61(5) has a dependency on Article 61(4), but Articles 61(4) and 61(6) are not dependent on Article 61(5).

| Case | Criteria for exemption from the Article 61(4) requirement for clinical investigations for implantable and class III devices |
| --- | --- |
| **CASE 1: Indents 1-3 of Article 61(4)** | • DUE has been designed by modifications of a device already marketed by the same manufacturer.<br>• Equivalence is demonstrated between the DUE and the manufacturer's ED in accordance with Section 3 of Annex XIV; demonstration of equivalence has been endorsed by the notified body. For further guidance on the demonstration of equivalence, please refer to MDCG 2020-5.<br>• The clinical evaluation of the marketed device is sufficient to demonstrate conformity of the modified device with the relevant safety and performance requirements 4, 5.<br>• PMCF plan is appropriate and includes post market studies to demonstrate the safety and performance of the DUE 6. |
| **CASE 2: Article 61(6)(a)** | • DUE has been lawfully placed on the market or put into service in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC.<br>• The clinical evaluation is based on sufficient clinical data 7.<br>• The clinical evaluation is in compliance with the relevant product-specific CS for the clinical evaluation of that kind of device, where such a CS is available. |
| **CASE 3: Article 61(6)(b)** | • DUE is one of the listed types of devices: 'sutures, staples, dental fillings, dental braces, tooth crowns, screws, wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips or connectors'.<br>• The clinical evaluation is based on sufficient clinical data 7.<br>• The clinical evaluation is in compliance with the relevant product-specific CS for the clinical evaluation of that kind of device, where such a CS is available. |
| **CASE 4: Article 61(5) 8** | • Equivalence is demonstrated between the DUE and the other manufacturer's ED in accordance with Section 3 of Annex XIV; demonstration of equivalence has been endorsed by the notified body (via Article 61(4)).<br>• The clinical data from the clinical evaluation of the ED is sufficient to support the intended purposes of the DUE (via Article 61(4)) 9.<br>• The two manufacturers have a contract in place that explicitly allows the manufacturer of the ED full access to the technical documentation on an ongoing basis.<br>• The clinical evaluation of the other manufacturer's ED has been performed in compliance with the requirements of the MDR 10, 11.<br>• PMCF plan is appropriate and includes post market studies to demonstrate the safety and performance of the DUE 6 (via Article 61(4)). |

In the case where a clinical investigation(s) is determined to be mandatory 12  in order to obtain the needed clinical data to support the clinical evidence for a claimed indication for use, the MDR does not specify the number or extent of the clinical investigation(s) required.  However,  as  a  minimum,  mandatory  clinical  investigation(s)  should  be understood to mean a pivotal clinical investigation(s) generating pivotal data.

### 5.  Demonstration of 'sufficient levels of access to the data' required to justify claims of equivalence

In addition to outlining the technical, biological and clinical characteristics to be taken into  consideration  for  the  demonstration  of  equivalence,  Annex  XIV  Section  3  MDR requires manufacturers to have '[…] sufficient levels of access to the data relating to devices  with  which  they  are  claiming  equivalence  in  order  to  justify  their  claims  of equivalence'. As clarified above, demonstration of 'sufficient levels of access' does not require a contract in all circumstances. A contract is only required for the exemption case described  in  Article  61(5).  It  should  also  be  noted  that  Annex  XIV  Section  3  refers specifically to the data required to justify claims of equivalence : i.e., the requirement is for  sufficient  access  to  establish  the  clinical,  technical  and  biological  characteristics against which  equivalence  is  evaluated,  not access  to the complete  technical documentation.

A contract as described in Article 61(5) is presumed to provide full access to the data needed for the demonstration of equivalence. However, in the cases where a contract is not  required,  other  means  of  access  to  data  can  prove  to  be  adequate  to  support demonstrations of  equivalence.  This  includes  CASEs  1,  2,  and  3;  it  also  includes  a specific subset of CASE 4, in which equivalence is fully demonstrated with more than one device from more than one manufacturer, and there is a contract in place with at least one of the manufacturers, see footnotes 3 and 11. The manufacturer of the DUE must document their justification within the CER as to why the level of access they have obtained is sufficient, and this has to be accepted by the notified body 13 .

Table 2 in Appendix II provides some examples of means of access to the data relevant for the demonstration of equivalence and suggests a hierarchy in relation to the level of access to this data. It also indicates potential limitations of these methods and means by which these limitations might be addressed. Table 2 is for illustrative purposes only, and is not intended to be exhaustive or prescriptive.

N.B. : A higher level of access is indicated where limitations are considered unacceptable and cannot be adequately addressed. In this context, an unacceptable limitation is one which compromises the completeness or accuracy of the demonstration of equivalence such  that  it  cannot  be  presumed  that  the  DUE  has  similar  safety  and  performance characteristics to the device with which equivalence is claimed.

It should also be noted that a higher level of access to data does not directly correlate to a stronger demonstration of equivalence. For example, in example 1a of Table 2, the manufacturer  of  the  DUE  has  complete  access  to  the  data  required  to  demonstrate equivalence, but the devices could still have differences in one or more of the clinical, technical or biological equivalence criteria described in Annex XIV Section 3 of the MDR. By contrast, in the case described in example 1d of Table 2, it may be presumed that the DUE is identical to its claimed equivalent.

If a manufacturer is not able to demonstrate sufficient levels of access to the data needed for  the  demonstration  of  equivalence,  equivalence  claims  cannot  be  made  for  the purpose of conformity assessment 13 .

| **Examples of means of demonstrating 'sufficient access to data'** | **Level of access and potential limitations** | **Means of addressing limitations 14** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1a.** Contract with the manufacturer of the ED allowing full access to the technical documentation on an ongoing basis | • Level of access: Full. | • N/A |
| **1b.** DUE is a design modification of a device already marketed by the same manufacturer | • Level of access: Full. | • N/A |

**Footnotes**

1. Article 61(4) states 'In addition, clinical investigations need not be performed in the cases referred to in paragraph 6'. The words 'in addition' indicates additional exemption cases which do not rely on the exemption criteria of Article 61(4) being met. i.e., CASE 2 and CASE 3, as described in Article 61(6)(a) and Article 61(6)(b), do not need to satisfy the additional requirements listed in Article 61(4).
2. It  can be inferred from this independence of paragraphs that the devices described in CASE 1 and CASE 4 are neither legacy devices as outlined in CASE 2 nor 'sutures, staples, dental fillings, dental braces, tooth crowns, screws, wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips or connectors' as outlined in CASE 3. i.e., the DUE described in Article 61(5) and indents 1-3 of Article 61(4) are new devices which have not previously been marketed under either the Directives or the MDR.
3. N.B., in CASE 4, a contract with at least one manufacturer will be required along with the other conditions described in Table 1. However, data from other manufacturers' devices (with which equivalence is demonstrated) can be used without a contract to supplement the data in the clinical evaluation, for those indications covered by the contract. See also footnote 11.
9. The MDR does not prohibit the use of equivalence, demonstrated in compliance with the MDR, in the clinical evaluation of ED.
10. The clinical evaluation for the other manufacturer's ED does not supersede the clinical evaluation for the DUE; the DUE clinical evaluation and its documentation are still required, in accordance with Article 61(1).
11. The MDR does not prohibit the use of clinical data from more than one manufacturer's ED in the clinical evaluation of the DUE. In this case, only one contract with one manufacturer is required for the exemption from the requirement for clinical investigations to apply for the specific indications for use covered by the existing contract.
