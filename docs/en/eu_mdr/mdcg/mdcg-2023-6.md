## Guidance on demonstration of equivalence for Annex XVI products

A guide for manufacturers and notified bodies

December 2023

This  document  has  been  endorsed  by  the  Medical  Device  Coordination  Group (MDCG)  established  by  Article  103  of  Regulation  (EU)  2017/745.  The  MDCG  is composed  of representatives of all Member  States and it is chaired by a representative of the European Commission.

The document is not a European Commission document and it cannot be regarded as reflecting the official position of the European Commission. Any views expressed in this document are not legally binding and only the Court of Justice of the European Union can give binding interpretations of Union law.

## 1 Introduction

The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices 1 , hereafter referred to as the MDR (medical device regulation), provides a possibility to use clinical data related to an equivalent device in the clinical evaluation required for a device under conformity assessment 2 .

Whilst carrying out a clinical investigation is the most direct way to generate clinical data concerning the  safety  and  performance  of  devices  for  the  purpose  of  CE  marking,  clinical  data  can  also  be sourced  from  data  of  a  device  for  which  the  equivalence  to  the  device  in  question  can  be demonstrated 3 . In such cases, equivalence shall be demonstrated according to the  MDR requirements 4 .

According to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2346 laying down  common specifications for the groups of products without an intended medical purpose listed in Annex XVI to Regulation  (EU)  2017/745  on  medical  devices 5 ,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  CS,  in  general  it  is  not possible to demonstrate equivalence between a medical device and a product without an intended medical purpose where all available results of clinical investigations relate to medical devices only. Therefore,  clinical  investigations  should  be  performed  for  products  without  an  intended  medical purpose 6 .

The  guidance  document  MDCG  20205  on  'Clinical  Evaluation  Equivalence' 7 also  covers  the products without an intended medical purpose listed in the Annex XVI of MDR 8 . It was issued in April 2020, before the availability of the CS and with the purposes of highlighting the differences between the MDR and the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev.4 9 .

## 2  Scope

This  MDCG  guidance  covers  the  demonstration  of  equivalence,  based  on  data  pertaining  to  an already existing device, for the purpose of CE-marking under the MDR and is applicable to products without an intended medical purpose listed in the Annex XVI of MDR and covered by the CS. For dual-purpose devices, which are devices with a medical and a non-medical intended purpose, this guidance applies only to the non-medical intended purpose.

This guidance document should be used in conjunction with MDCG 2020-5 on equivalence.

## 3 Demonstration of equivalence

## 3.1 Product without an intended medical purpose vs product without an intended medical purpose

When  referring  to  clinical  data  from  an  equivalent  device,  manufacturers  should  consider  that equivalence between two devices without an intended medical purpose should be demonstrated in accordance  with  the  criteria  established  in  the  MDR 10 .  In  particular,  the  demonstration  has  to consider technical, biological and clinical characteristics.

The  technical  and  biological  criteria  listed  in  the  MDR  can  be  directly  considered  to  compare characteristics  of  products  without  an  intended  medical  purpose.  The  criterion  for  the  clinical characteristics should be considered taking into account that some of them are specifically referring to a medical purpose. The following table clarifies how the characteristics should be considered for products without an intended medical purpose.

| has similar relevant critical performance                                  | 'similar relevant critical performance' is directly applicable                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| in view of the expected clinical effect for a specific intended purpose    | the expected 'clinical' effect is not applicable. Nevertheless, the products have expected effects for the specific intended purpose, therefore the requirement should be considered as 'in view of the expected effect for a specific intended purpose' |

## 3.2 Product without an intended medical purpose vs analogous medical device

In general, a comparison is not possible between a medical device and a product without an intended medical  purpose 11 because  not  all  the  clinical  characteristics  can  be  compared.  In  particular,  the characteristic 'similar severity and stage of disease' would be defined and available for the medical device  while  it  would  not  be  defined  and  available  for  the  product  without  an  intended  medical purpose 12 .  As  a  consequence,  the  demonstration  of  equivalence  cannot  be  completed  and established between a device without an intended medical purpose and an analogous device with a medical purpose 13 .

## 3.3 Product without an intended medical purpose vs dual-purpose device

Equivalence  between  a  product  without  an  intended  medical  purpose  and  a  device  with  both  a medical  and  a  non-medical  purpose  (dual-purpose  device)  can  be  demonstrated  comparing  the characteristics related to the non-medical purpose for both the devices. For the dual-purpose device, only the characteristics related to the non-medical purpose should be considered.

If equivalence is demonstrated, only clinical data of the dual-purpose device related to the general safety and performance requirements 14 applicable for the non-medical purpose should be used for the clinical evaluation of the product without an intended medical purpose.
