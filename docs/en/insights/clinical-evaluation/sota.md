The “Clinical Background (State-of-the-Art, SOTA)” chapter within the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP) is a critical segment for establishing the clinical value and positioning of the medical device under evaluation. The core objective of this chapter is to systematically and objectively articulate the current body of medical knowledge and standard clinical practices relevant to the device. By clearly defining the associated disease(s), existing diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, alternative treatment options, and their generally accepted levels of safety and performance, the SOTA provides essential context and benchmarks for the subsequent determination of the clinical evaluation’s scope, endpoint selection, and acceptance criteria.

## **Clinical Background**

This section is dedicated to constructing a clear and comprehensive cognitive framework for the specific medical field in which the device under evaluation will be applied.

Firstly, the **specific medical condition or disease** directly related to the device’s intended use must be precisely defined. This involves a systematic description of the disease’s **definition, epidemiological characteristics** (such as prevalence, incidence, and relevant demographic features like age and gender distribution), primary **risk factors** , and recognized **pathophysiological mechanisms**. Subsequently, the **spectrum of clinical manifestations** of the disease should be detailed, progressing from early or asymptomatic stages, through various typical signs and symptoms as the disease advances, to the most severe clinical phases. Furthermore, information on the natural history, progression, and overall prognosis of the disease should be included. All such descriptions must be grounded in currently accepted medical literature and authoritative data, with appropriately cited sources.

Following a clear exposition of the disease overview, the narrative should transition to an analysis of the **existing challenges and unmet clinical needs** within current clinical practice. This requires identifying and articulating the deficiencies or difficulties that persist in the diagnosis, treatment, or long-term management of the disease under the prevailing healthcare models. For instance, this might involve issues with diagnostic accuracy in specific patient subgroups, inconsistencies in clinical practice standards amidst the rapid evolution of different treatment technologies, or a lack of standardized guidelines for certain refined procedures. Additionally, limitations in enhancing long-term efficacy with current treatment methods, disparities in access to diagnosis and treatment due to uneven resource allocation, or technical barriers posed by specific pathological changes are all aspects worthy of discussion. Accurately identifying these unmet needs helps to subsequently substantiate the potential clinical contribution of the device under evaluation.

Next, a systematic overview of **current diagnostic methods and standardized procedures** for the disease is required. This should begin with fundamental clinical assessments (including detailed history taking and physical examination) and progressively introduce and evaluate core non-invasive and invasive diagnostic techniques. Throughout this process, recommendations from relevant professional society clinical guidelines (e.g., NICE, ACC/AHA, ESVS) concerning diagnostic pathways should be integrated and cited to reflect current standardized diagnostic practice.

Subsequent to diagnostic methods, **mainstream therapeutic strategies and recognized “gold standard” therapies** (if any exist) for the disease should be exhaustively detailed. This typically begins with an introduction to foundational, comprehensive treatment measures, such as lifestyle interventions (e.g., smoking cessation advice), systematic management of risk factors (e.g., control of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia), and core pharmacological treatment regimens (e.g., application of antiplatelet agents, statins). For different stages, types, or severities of the disease, their respective recommended treatment plans and hierarchical approaches should be elucidated. When discussing various treatment options, the evidence-based rationale for their selection, such as patient risk stratification and anatomical lesion characteristics, should also be analyzed. Citing recommendations from authoritative clinical guidelines is key to ensuring the professionalism of this section.

Finally, concerning the clinical application related to the type of device under evaluation (or the key medical procedure it facilitates), it is imperative to clearly articulate the industry-accepted clinical endpoints used to assess its safety and performance. If the device itself has specific performance parameters crucial to its clinical application, these parameters should be discussed along with any unique adverse events directly attributable to the device, explained in conjunction with standard operating procedures and usage recommendations. When presenting these endpoints, **quantitative data or acceptable ranges** from published literature or guidelines should be provided whenever possible. The appropriate use of tables to summarize core recommendations from key international guidelines or significant data can enhance the efficiency and clarity of information delivery.

## **Alternative Options**

This section aims to objectively and comprehensively present other currently available **alternative treatment options** in clinical practice, aside from the device under evaluation (or its related therapy).

Firstly, these alternative options should be **systematically reviewed and described**. Depending on their nature, these options can be broadly categorized as:

  * **Conservative treatment or non-interventional management**
  * **Other types of interventional or surgical treatment technique**
  * **Other potentially relevant adjunctive or special treatment modalities**

Following a thorough description of the various alternative options, the core element is to conduct a **judicious comparative analysis**. This entails objectively comparing the device under evaluation (or the core therapeutic procedure it supports) with these alternatives against recognized key clinical endpoints for safety and performance. Such comparisons must be based on high-quality, evidence-based medicine, such as published randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, as well as recommendations from authoritative clinical guidelines. Clear and standardized citation of these evidence sources is crucial. When narrating complex comparative data, supplementing with well-designed tables for summary can significantly enhance the readability and impact of the information. When conducting comparative analysis, neutrality and objectivity must be maintained, reasonably presenting potential clinical benefits or characteristics of the device under evaluation (or its related therapy) compared to some alternatives, while also truthfully reflecting its possible shortcomings or its comparability in efficacy and safety with other established options.
