# Objectives, Inputs and Device Under Evaluation

## **Objective**

The primary objective of the clinical evaluation must be clearly articulated at the outset of the CEP. The evaluation aims to systematically confirm the safety and clinical performance of the medical device under evaluation when used for its intended purpose, in line with the EU Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR 2017/745). It should be highlighted that this process is conducted to satisfy the clinical evidence requirements stipulated in Article 61 of the MDR and to demonstrate the device’s conformity with the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs), particularly GSPR 1 (regarding achieving intended purpose safely and effectively) and GSPR 8 (concerning clinical evaluation).

This section also defines the role of the CEP itself: a detailed plan specifying how clinical data pertinent to the device will be methodically collected, rigorously assessed, and scientifically analyzed. A critical aspect involves comparing this data against the current, generally acknowledged state of the art (SOTA) relevant to the device’s intended purpose under normal conditions of use. All findings and conclusions from the clinical evaluation will be documented in the final Clinical Evaluation Report (CER).

## **Input Documentation**

A clinical evaluation relies on an adequate and reliable foundation of existing information. Therefore, the CEP must clearly list all input documents that provide critical information for the evaluation. These documents are the starting point for planning and analysis. A comprehensive list should include at least:

  * **Document Title/Type** : e.g., latest Instructions for Use (IFU)/User Manual, complete Risk Management File (including Risk Management Plan, Risk Analysis Report, Risk Management Report), preclinical study reports (such as bench testing, animal studies), biocompatibility assessment reports, design verification and validation reports.
  * **Document Number** : For traceability and easy reference.
  * **Date or Revision** : To ensure the current and effective version is utilized.

## **Device Under Evaluation**

Initially, basic administrative information is necessary, including the manufacturer’s full legal name, detailed address, and Single Registration Number (SRN) if required (e.g., by EUDAMED). If applicable, the full name, address, and SRN of the EU Authorized Representative needs be listed.

The core of this section is **Device Identification**. The device(s) covered by the CEP must be described in detail. This usually begins with the device’s trade name, specific model(s), or model range (if it’s a product family), and its current regulatory status (e.g., initial MDR CE marking application or existing certifications). Using a table is recommended to clearly present product information, which should include:

  * **Model(s)**
  * **Description** : Including main constituent materials, key components, and basic specs.
  * **CE Marking Date** : State “N/A” or “Pending” for initial applications.
  * **Classification** : The device’s risk class according to MDR Annex VIII rules, including the applied classification rule.
  * **Distribution Regions**

Following this, the product’s **Features** should be elaborated. Provide a detailed, illustrated description of unique functions and design characteristics.

Next, describe the product’s **Principles of Operation** or mechanism of action in detail. Explain how the device achieves its intended function and the scientific basis. Schematic diagrams can be useful for complex mechanisms.

The **Intended Purpose of the Device Under Evaluation** must be precisely stated and be consistent with the product label, IFU, and risk management documentation. This typically includes:

  * **Intended Use Statement** : A precise definition of the medical purpose, the part of the body it acts on/in, and how it is used.
  * **Indications For Use** : Specific diseases, symptoms, or medical conditions for which the device is indicated.
  * **Target Population** : Characteristics of intended patients (age, sex, health status, etc.).
  * **Intended Users** : Qualifications and professional background of personnel operating or using the device.
  * **Contraindications** : Situations where the device must not be used.
  * **Warnings** : Information on potential serious risks or safety hazards.
  * **Precautions** : Measures to ensure safe and effective use and avoid non-serious problems.

Closely related is the **Clinical Benefit**. Articulate the actual, measurable clinical benefits the device is expected to provide to patients, directly stemming from its safety and performance.

**Performance and Safety Endpoints** are critical. For each clinical claim or intended benefit, establish specific, measurable, and relevant safety and performance evaluation endpoints. A table is highly recommended to present:

  * **Claim or Benefit** : Derived from the intended purpose and clinical benefits.
  * **Relevant Safety (S) and Performance (P) Objectives** : Specific parameters to be verified by clinical data.
  * **Acceptance Criteria with Justification** : Clear, quantifiable success criteria and the scientific basis for them (e.g., published standards, SOTA comparisons, preclinical test results, accepted clinical practice).

Briefly introduce the **Device History**. State if the device is new or an improvement on an existing one. If modified, outline main design changes and update history. Mention any previous certifications or market history in other regions.

Finally, if the device is already marketed (even outside the EU or under previous directives), provide the **Number of Devices on the Market** and relevant post-market surveillance (PMS) information. This includes the first marketing date, approximate units sold, and a summary of adverse event reports, user complaints, and any related corrective/preventive actions from real-world use.
