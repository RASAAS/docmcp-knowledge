# Clinical Evaluation Report (CER)

The Clinical Evaluation Report (CER) is the final output of the clinical evaluation process. It systematically documents the activities carried out according to the Clinical Evaluation Plan (CEP), the data collected, the analysis performed, and the conclusions reached regarding the medical device’s safety, clinical performance, and benefit-risk balance. Its primary purpose is to demonstrate the device’s conformity with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) of the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR).

## **1\. Introduction and Background Review**

The opening section of the CER should briefly reiterate the **clinical evaluation objectives, scope, and key information about the device under evaluation** as set out in the CEP. This includes:

  * **Restating Objectives and Scope:** Reaffirm that the clinical evaluation aimed to confirm the device’s safety and performance to meet MDR requirements like GSPR 1 and GSPR 8. Clearly state that this CER is the result of executing a specific CEP.
  * **List of Input Documents:** Enumerate the key documents actually referenced and relied upon during the evaluation (e.g., risk management report, IFU, preclinical study reports, previous CEP/CER versions).
  * **Device Description Summary:** Accurately describe the evaluated device model(s), intended use, classification, and other core identifying information so the reader clearly understands the subject of the evaluation.

## **2\. Presentation of the State-of-the-Art (SOTA)**

In the CER, this section is not about planning how to research the SOTA, but rather about **actually presenting** the clinical background established by executing the SOTA research plan from the CEP. It should include:

  * A summary of the relevant medical condition, existing treatment modalities, alternative options, and the safety and performance levels of similar/benchmark devices.
  * A list of applicable standards and guidance documents that served as references during the evaluation.

## **3\. Reporting of Data Collection and Appraisal Results**

This is the main body of the CER, detailing the **actual execution and results** of data collection and appraisal as planned in the CEP (particularly the Literature Search Protocol (LSP) and data appraisal plan).

  * **Summary of Manufacturer-Held Data:** Present the main results and conclusions of completed preclinical studies (e.g., bench tests, biocompatibility, animal studies). If manufacturer-sponsored clinical investigations were conducted, report their design, execution, and key safety and performance data. If the device is marketed, summarize relevant PMS and PMCF data.
  * **Literature Search and Screening Results:** Detail the execution of the literature search (e.g., databases searched, dates, search strings used, number of hits), and clearly present the literature screening process and results (number of articles included/excluded and reasons), often using a PRISMA flow diagram.
  * **Demonstration of Equivalence (if applicable):** If the CEP planned evaluation via the equivalence pathway, the CER must detail the results of the comparative analysis of clinical, technical, and biological characteristics with the chosen equivalent device(s). It must also provide justifications for the clinical significance of any differences, ultimately concluding whether equivalence is demonstrated.
  * **Implementation of Data Appraisal:** Describe how all collected relevant data (from literature, clinical investigations, PMS, etc.) was appraised for relevance, quality, and scientific validity, according to the pre-defined criteria and methods outlined in the CEP.

## **4\. Comprehensive Analysis of Clinical Data and Conclusions**

This is the core analytical section of the CER, integrating all appraised relevant data for a thorough analysis and subsequent conclusions.

  * **Safety Analysis:** Based on all data sources (especially clinical investigations, adverse event reports from literature, safety database information), comprehensively assess the device’s safety profile. Analyze the nature, incidence, and severity of adverse events, their potential relationship to the device, and compare this with the SOTA. Conclude on the device’s conformity with GSPR 1 regarding safety.
  * **Performance Analysis:** Based on clinical investigation data, equivalent device data, or high-quality literature data, evaluate whether the device achieves its claimed clinical performance and intended purpose. Compare actual performance data against SOTA or pre-defined acceptance criteria. Conclude on the device’s conformity with GSPR 1 regarding performance.
  * **Benefit-Risk Analysis:** Critically determine the benefit-risk profile by synthesizing the safety and performance analyses. Clearly articulate the device’s main clinical benefits, weigh them against identified risks (including residual risks), and, in the context of SOTA, justify that the overall benefit outweighs the risk and that the benefit-risk ratio is acceptable, meeting GSPR 1 and GSPR 8.
  * **Analysis of Acceptability of Side-Effects:** Specifically discuss side-effects associated with the device, assess their nature, incidence, and clinical manageability, and justify their acceptability in the context of clinical benefits, meeting GSPR 8.

## **5\. Integration with Risk Management Activities**

The CER should clearly demonstrate how the clinical evaluation findings interact with the risk management process. Confirm that clinical risks identified in the risk management file have been adequately assessed through this clinical evaluation and that all residual risks are acceptable in the context of clinical benefits. If new risks or changes in the understanding of existing risks emerged during the clinical evaluation, state that this information has been fed back into the risk management system for updates.

## **6\. Review and Outlook of the Clinical Development Plan (CDP)**

Briefly review the execution of the Clinical Development Plan outlined in the CEP, summarizing completed activities and their contribution to this clinical evaluation. Also, provide an outlook on future CDP activities, particularly ongoing planning for Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF), to ensure continuous monitoring and validation of the device’s long-term safety and performance.

## **7\. Final Conclusions**

The concluding section of the CER must provide a clear, affirmative **overall conclusion** :

  * Summarize that this clinical evaluation has sufficiently demonstrated the safety, clinical performance, and claimed clinical benefits of the device under evaluation for its intended use.
  * Declare that the device conforms with the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements of the MDR (particularly GSPR 1 and GSPR 8).
  * Confirm that the device’s benefit-risk profile is acceptable under the intended conditions of use.

## **8\. Date of Next Clinical Evaluation**

Finally, in accordance with regulatory requirements and the device’s characteristics, clearly state the date or frequency for the next update of this CER.
