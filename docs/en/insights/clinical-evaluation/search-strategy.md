# Literature Search Strategy

This process can be assisted by **AI tools**, including search strategy formulation and medical guideline retrieval, significantly improving literature analysis efficiency and reducing manual screening burden.

Literature database searches are based on the **PICO framework** (Population, Intervention, Control, Outcome), considering literature related to the subject device (if applicable) and comparator devices. When too many irrelevant records are retrieved, multiple **AND** Boolean operators and MeSH subject headings are used to narrow the search.

**Special Notes:**
- **Embase**: Use the "Quick Search" function.
- **Cochrane**: Use "Advanced Search" and select "Cochrane Reviews" and "Trials" under search limits.
- **CNKI and Wanfang**: Results restricted to Chinese-language literature.

## Literature Search for EU MDR Compliance

### Search Scope Requirements

Per MDR Article 61 and MDCG 2020-6, the literature search must cover:
- State of the Art
- Currently available alternative treatments
- Clinical data for benchmark/similar devices
- Clinical data for equivalent devices (if equivalence is claimed)
- Identified safety concerns and adverse event reports

### Search Time Frame
- Basic search: literature from the past 5 years (consistent with State of the Art principles)
- Safety issues: may require extension to earlier literature
- Current state of technology: prioritise the most recent guidelines and reviews

### Search Quality Assurance

To ensure compliance with MDCG 2020-6:
- Search strategies must be traceable and reproducible
- Search dates and databases must be documented
- Rationale for search term selection must be stated
- Completeness and systematic nature of the search must be demonstrated

### Ongoing Literature Monitoring

Per MDR Article 83 and MDCG 2020-6:
- Establish a literature monitoring mechanism
- Regularly update search strategies
- Promptly identify newly emerging safety issues
- Assess the impact on the device's benefit-risk profile
