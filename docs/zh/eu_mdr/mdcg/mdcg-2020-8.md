## Introduction

The Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) considers the post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) as a continuous process that updates the clinical evaluation and that shall be addressed in the manufacturer's post-market surveillance plan. The MDR reinforces the PMCF process by the manufacturer, devoting part B of Annex XIV to it and providing a set of requirements for developing a PMCF plan and its evaluation report, necessary to its implementation.

The manufacturer shall analyse the findings coming from the activities foreseen in the PMCF plan and document the results in this PMCF evaluation report that shall be part of the clinical evaluation report and the technical documentation.

The  conclusions  of  the  PMCF  evaluation  report  shall  be  taken  into  account  to  update  eventually  the  clinical  evaluation,  the  risk management documentation, the post market surveillance plan and the SSCP, if applicable.

The purpose of the present templates is to guide manufacturers in complying with the requirements of the MDR with respect to the compilation of  the PMCF evaluation report. This would assist manufacturers in a harmonised and complete presentation of post market clinical data and facilitate the activity of notified bodies and competent authorities in finding the information in an organized format.

## Section C.   Activities undertaken related to PMCF: results

In this section the manufacturer shall report all the activities described in section C of the PMCF plan which have been performed, all the collected clinical data obtained from those completed activities, as well as any justification of deviations from the plan.

The discussion shall include the analysis of the findings, whether positive or negative and also the potential impact on the different documents (clinical evaluation report, risk management file, SSCP, etc…) initially reviewed during the conformity assessment.

It is expected for each activity performed, a description in different subsections, related to the type of activities (device registry, PMCF studies, real world evidence, surveys about the use of device, etc…), and for each subsection, a description about the quality of data collected. 5

## Section D.  Evaluation of clinical data relating to equivalent or similar devices

In this section the manufacturer shall report all the clinical data collected relating to an equivalent device or selected similar device(s), provide an analysis and conclusions, and whether changes of the state of the art, or newly identified hazards would have an impact on the devices benefit-risk determination, the clinical evaluation and/or the PMCF plan.
