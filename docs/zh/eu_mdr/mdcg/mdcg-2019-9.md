## March 2022

## Introduction

The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (1) requires that the manufacturer shall draw up a summary of safety and clinical performance (SSCP) for  implantable  devices  and  for  class  III  devices,  other  than  custom-made  or investigational  devices.  The  SSCP  shall  be  validated  by  a  notified  body  (NB)  and made  available  to  the  public  via  the  European  database  on  medical  devices (Eudamed) 1 .

The SSCP is intended to provide public access to an updated summary of clinical data 2  and other information about the safety and clinical performance of the medical device. The SSCP will be an important source of information for intended users  both healthcare professionals and if relevant for patients. It is one of several means intended to fulfil the objectives of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) to enhance transparency and provide adequate access to information 3 .

The SSCP is not intended to:

- give  general  advice  on  the  diagnosis  or  treatment  of  particular  medical conditions, nor
- replace  the  instructions  for  use  (IFU)  as  the  main  document  that  will  be provided to ensure the safe use of a particular device, nor
- replace the mandatory  information on implant cards 4 or in any other mandatory documents.

The  main  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  provide  guidance  on  the  presentation, content  and  validation  of  the  SSCP.  The  word  'shall'  is  used  when  there  is  a corresponding 'shall' in the MDR, otherwise 'should' or 'recommended' etc. is used indicating the interpretation of the MDR.

## General requirements and recommendations for the SSCP

The  information  in  the  SSCP  should  be  sourced  entirely  from  the  technical documentation  (TD)  of  the  device 15 .  Examples  of  such  documents  are  design verification/validation reports, the risk management report/file, the clinical evaluation report,  and  post-market  surveillance  (PMS)  and  post-market  clinical  follow-up (PMCF) plans and reports. The IFU includes information extracted from the same sources  as  the  SSCP,  but  may  itself  be  used  as  a  source  for  the  SSCP  if appropriate.

The  manufacturer  will  assign  to  the  SSCP  an  identifier  (reference  number)  that within  the  manufacturer's  management  system  is  unique  to  that  SSCP  and  will remain  the  same  for  the  entire  lifetime  of  the  SSCP.  In  combination  with  the manufacturer's  SRN  this  will  allow  for  the  unique  identification  of  the  SSCP  in EUDAMED and in EU.

The SSCP shall be kept updated in Eudamed 16 . When the PMCF evaluation report 17 and the periodic safety update report (PSUR) 18  are updated at least annually 19 , the SSCP shall be reviewed and updated 20  if needed to ensure that any clinical and/or safety  information  in  the  SSCP  remains  correct  and  complete. When updating the SSCP, all sections of the document shall be updated if needed so that they are in alignment with the most current version of the relevant parts of the TD of the device.

This guide outlines the minimum content of the SSCP. The manufacturer may add further information from the TD of the device to enhance the comprehension of the mandatory information providing:

- it does not affect the readability of the SSCP and
- it excludes any element of a promotional nature.

The  SSCP  shall  be  objective  and  adequately  summarise  both  favourable  and unfavourable data 21 .

For further guidance on the contents of the SSCP, please refer to sections 1-8 of this document  and  to  the  template  in  the  Appendix.  The  format  and  structure  of  this template is recommended. It addresses all of the SSCP content requirements of the MDR 22 , but the order has been revised to enhance its presentation.

The IFU shall contain all that is needed to directly find the SSCP in Eudamed. The following applies to the IFU 23 .

- It shall state that the SSCP is available in the European database on medical devices (Eudamed), where it is linked to the Basic UDI-DI.
- It should provide the URL to the Eudamed public website: https://ec.europa.eu/tools/eudamed
- It should state the value of the Basic UDI-DI. Alternatively, another metadata can be stated provided it can be used to unambiguously search and find the intended SSCP in Eudamed.

## Translations to other EU languages

No single language will be understood by all intended users and patients in the EU see  the  European  Survey  on  Language  Competences  initiated  by  the  European Commission (4). In order to meet the requirement in the MDR that the SSCP shall be written in a way that is clear to the intended user and, if relevant, to the patient 24 , the SSCP should be translated into the languages accepted in the Member States where the device is envisaged to be sold. This is by analogy with the requirement for an IFU 25 . Note that Member States may have different language requirements for an IFU depending on whether the information is intended for health care professionals or  for  patients.  The  SSCP  part  intended  for  patients  should  be  provided  in  all  the languages required for IFUs intended for patients in the Member States concerned.

If the selection of European languages for the SSCP does not include English, then an English translation of the document should also be provided. English is the most common language used in medical scientific publications and is understood by many healthcare professionals in the EU. Always providing an English-language version of the SSCP further enhances access to information 26  about devices available on the EU market.

There  should  be  one  SSCP  document  for  each  language.  Each  SSCP  document should state in which language the SSCP  was  validated  by the  NB.  The manufacturer  should  ensure,  through  their  quality  management  system,  that  the translations are correct.

## Relevant SSCP information for patients

The MDR indicates that patients are also intended recipients of the information in the SSCP, 'if  relevant' 27 .  Devices  for  which  information  will  be  especially  relevant  for patients include:

- implantable devices for which patients will be given implant cards 28 , and
- class III devices that are intended to be used directly by patients.

For these devices, a part of the SSCP specifically intended for patients should be provided.

Note: Devices listed in MDR Annex XVI, and eligible for a SSCP, should always be considered as relevant for patient information.

For devices other than the two groups listed above, including any devices listed in Annex XVI  and  eligible  for  a  SSCP,  the  manufacturer  may  consider  whether  it  is relevant to provide specific information intended for patients. This can be based on the manufacturer's analysis of the device in question.

## Readability

The SSCP should always have one part for intended users/healthcare professionals, and when it is relevant (see above) a second part for patients. Both should be clear and provide information at an appropriate depth to reflect the healthcare professionals' and the patients' different levels of knowledge 29 .

For  further  guidance,  see  references  (5)  and  (6)  in  this  guide.  It  should  not  be assumed that the  patient  has  any  formal  education  in  a  medical  discipline  or  any prior knowledge of medical terminology or clinical research. It is recommended that the readability of the part of the SSCP intended for patients is assessed for example by  a  test  given  to  lay  persons.  The  manufacturer  may  use  a  method  it  finds adequate for the readability test to confirm that the SSCP is written in a way that is clear to the patient 30 .

Medical terminology, relevant for the medical device and the clinical context, should be used consistently throughout the part of the SSCP that is intended for healthcare professionals.

## Stylistic recommendations

The SSCP should be presented in an organised and unambiguous manner.

Usually, abbreviations and acronyms should not be used; if they are, then in the text, the abbreviation or acronym should follow the full phrase it is intended to replace. It may then be used thereafter throughout the document.

Medical  terms  should  be  explained  in  simple  language  in  the  parts  intended  for patients.  Consistency  should  be  assured by  giving  the  lay  term  with  a  description first, and then the medical term immediately afterwards (in brackets). On a case-bycase basis the lay or medical term (but preferably the lay term) may then be used throughout the part intended for patients.

It is recommended to keep the information for patients/lay persons and for intended users/healthcare professionals in two separate parts of the SSCP, separated by a 'page  break'.  This  enhances  their  readability  and  facilitates  printing  of  each  part separately. See the template in the Appendix of this document.

The SSCP should be written in a font type and size which allow easy reading. Since the SSCP is intended for the public, it needs to be in a format that everyone can read (and that is not editable) without the need for a license. Therefore the SSCP file uploaded  in  Eudamed  should  be  in  PDF  format. When  downloaded,  the  PDF  file should be printable and searchable with the search function in the program used to view the file, for example the Adobe Reader.

## Validation and uploading of the SSCP

## Validation of the initial SSCP by the NB

When the NB has assessed that all the required elements 31  are included in the draft SSCP,  accurately  presented  and  in  alignment  with  the  most  current  version  of relevant documents in the TD, the SSCP has been validated by the NB.

In the circumstance that the conformity assessment is performed according to Annex X and XI in the MDR and there are two NBs involved, it is the NB which assesses the TD according to Annex X that shall validate the SSCP.

The validation of the SSCP by the NB covers only one of the language(s) accepted by the NB and agreed with the manufacturer. The manufacturer should state in the revision history in each SSCP document in which language the SSCP was validated by the NB.

The  timing  of  the  SSCP  validation  may  depend  on  the  class  of  device  and  the conformity assessment routes:

- For  class  III  devices  and  class  IIb  implantable  devices,  except  sutures  and staples etc. 32 , the validation is performed when a draft SSCP as a part of the application  documents  is  submitted  to  the  NB  involved  in  the  conformity assessment 33 , prior to issuing the certificate.
- For class IIa implantable and some IIb implantable devices such as sutures and staples etc 34 , a draft SSCP as a part of the application documents shall be  submitted  to  the  NB  involved  in  the  conformity  assessment.  The  draft SSCP shall be validated by the NB 35 .

In  the  circumstance  if  more  than  one  device  is  covered  by  the  relevant certificate,  at  least  one  draft  SSCP  shall  be  validated  against  relevant documents in the TD during the initial conformity assessment, prior to issuing the certificate.

Draft SSCPs that are not validated at the initial conformity assessment, shall be validated against relevant documents in the TD at least once during the period of validity of the certificate.

## Validation of updates of the SSCP between certification activities

The manufacturer has an obligation to keep the SSCP updated; for further details see the section 'General requirements and recommendations for the SSCP' in this guide. Furthermore the manufacturer shall prepare a periodic safety update report (PSUR) that includes data gathered as a result of the post-market surveillance plan, description  of  any  preventive  and  corrective  actions  taken,  conclusions  of  the benefit-risk determination, and the main findings of the PMCF 36 .

If the PSUR contains information rendering any information in the SSCP incorrect or incomplete,  the  SSCP  shall  be  updated 37   to  be  in  line  with  the  information  in  the most recent PSUR.

The manufacturer shall submit a PSUR to the NB at least annually, or for class IIa implantable devices 38  at least every two years 39 .

If the SSCP has been updated with new/changed information, except for strictly editorial modifications, the manufacturer should submit the updated SSCP to the NB when submitting the required PSUR.

- If the SSCP has been previously validated, the NB should validate the updated SSCP against the submitted and evaluated PSUR. Both the NB and the manufacturer should make an effort to keep the validation time short in order to meet the MDR requirement of an update of the SSCP at least annually if indicated 40 .
- If the SSCP has not previously been validated 41 , the NB may defer the validation until a validation against the relevant documents in the TD is planned during the period of validity of the certificate.

In  addition,  as  part  of  its  surveillance  activities,  the  NB shall  verify  that  the manufacturer  has  appropriately  updated  the  SSCP.  The  NB  should  take  into consideration its  assessment of the PMS plan and PSUR, the PMCF plan and its evaluation report, and/or other relevant information.

## Validation of SSCP at certificate renewal

With each certificate renewal application, the manufacturer should:

- For class III devices and class IIb implantable devices, other than sutures and staples etc. 42 , submit a draft SSCP which has been updated within the previous 12 months, regardless of whether there are new data or conclusions.
- For class IIa implantable and IIb implantable devices, such as sutures and staples etc. 43 , confirm that the SSCP in Eudamed is in alignment with the current version of the TD, or provide an updated SSCP where required.

At  certificate  renewal,  the  same  principles  should  apply  for  the  validation  of  the SSCP documents as at the initial certification.

## Uploading of the SSCP in Eudamed

The SSCP shall be uploaded in Eudamed by the NB 44 , which is the only actor that can  manage  the  SSCPs  in  Eudamed.  Timelines  for  uploading  of  the  SSCP documents in Eudamed:

- The  NB  shall  upload  the  SSCP  validated  in  conjunction  with  an  initial conformity assessment at the same time that it uploads the issued certificate.
- For  class  IIa  implantable  and  IIb  implantable  devices,  such  as  sutures  and staples etc. 45 , the NB shall upload the SSCPs of all the devices covered by the issued certificate at the same time that it uploads the issued certificate, even  if  some  of  the  SSCPs  have  not  been  validated  yet,  and  are  to  be validated during the period of validity of the certificate.

The manufacturer  should  state  in  a  revision  history  in  the  SSCP  document whether that revision was validated by the NB. It is important and should be transparent to the public 46  whether the SSCP document has been validated yet by the NB. See the example of a revision history in section 9 and in the template in the Appendix of this guide.

- The NB shall upload a SSCP whenever it has been validated against relevant documents  in  the  TD,  and  thus  replacing  the  SSCP  uploaded  at  the  initial certification with the currently validated revision.
- The manufacturer is responsible for the translations of the SSCP into other languages 47 , once the 'master' SSCP has been uploaded by the NB.
- If  the  'master'  SSCP  is  in  a  language  other  than  English,  then  an  English translation  should  be  provided  by  the  manufacturer  within  90  days  of  the upload of the 'master' SSCP. The NB should upload the English translation within 15 days of receiving this from the manufacturer.
- The  manufacturer  decides  when  it  translates  the  initial  'master'  SSCP  into other  languages  in  the  Member  States  depending  on  when/if  they  plan  to place the product on that market.

The NB does not validate the translated SSCP documents. It should upload them in Eudamed within 15 days of receiving them.

The manufacturer shall verify that the SSCP, and any translations needed for any single Member State, have been uploaded in Eudamed before placing a device on that market 48 .

- When receiving an updated SSCP document in conjunction with the PSUR, the NB should upload the updated SSCP document within 15 days after it is validated, or within 15 days after deeming the validation to be deferred 49  until a validation against the relevant documents in the TD is planned during the period of validity of the certificate.
- At  certificate  renewal,  the  NB  shall  upload  any  updated  SSCPs  of  all  the devices covered by the reissued certificate at the same time that it uploads the reissued certificate. The NB should ensure the revision history indicates whether or not these have been validated by the NB.
- The  manufacturer  should  provide  updated  translations  to  the  NB  within  90 days of  the  upload  of  the  updated  'master'  SSCP.    The  NB  should  upload these translations within 15 days of receiving them from the manufacturer.

## Guidance for each of the required sections of the SSCP document

### 1. The identification of the device and the manufacturer, including the Basic UDI-DI and, if already issued, the SRN

The first section of the SSCP shall identify the device and the manufacturer, and should also contain some general information related to the device:

- 1.1.  Device trade name(s) (this include all trade names the device may have on the market in different Member States)
- 1.2.  Manufacturer's name and address
- 1.3.  Manufacturer's SRN (single registration number)
- 1.4.  Basic UDI-DI
- 1.5.  Medical device nomenclature 50  description / text
- 1.6.  Class of device 51
- 1.7.  Year when the first certificate (CE) was issued covering the device
- 1.8.  Authorised representative if applicable; name and the SRN
- 1.9.  NB's  name  (the  NB  that  will  validate  the  SSCP)  and  the  NB's  single identification number 52

### 2. The intended purpose of the device and any indications, contraindications and target populations

2.1.  The device's intended purpose(s) shall be described.

- 2.2.  The indications shall be described. This includes the stages and/or severities of the pathologies, the specific medical conditions, and the specific anatomical locations or confirmation that no anatomical locations are contraindicated, as applicable. The target population(s) shall be specified, for example if the device is intended for adults and/or children and/or infants/neonates.
- 2.3.  Any contraindications or restrictions for use or limitations of the device shall be included.

The  information  can  be  sourced  from  the  IFU,  or  from  the  clinical  evaluation report.

3. A description of the device, including a reference to previous generation(s) or  variants  if  such  exist,  and  a  description  of  the  differences,  as  well  as, where  relevant,  a  description  of  any  accessories,  other  devices  and products, which are intended to be used in combination with the device
2. 3.1.  A  description  of  the  device  shall  be  presented,  including  its  operating principles and mode(s) of action. Design characteristics should be included, for  example  key  functional  elements  and  any  materials  or  substances  in contact with the patient's tissues. Include information on whether the device is for single use, and its method of sterilisation. For absorbable implants the stability retention profile, including time to loss of stability and the absorption time, should be provided.

A picture or drawing can be added accompanied by text.

Information  about  the  constituents  should  be  provided,  as  required  for  the IFU 53 , if the device incorporates

- a medicinal substance (including a human blood or plasma derivative), or
- tissue(s) or cells of human or animal origin, or their derivatives, or
- substances or combinations of substances that are absorbed by or locally dispersed in the human body, or
- materials  incorporated  into  the  device  that  contain  or  consist  of  CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction) substances or endocrine-disrupting substances, or
- materials  that  could  result  in  sensitisation  or  an  allergic  reaction  by  the patient or user.

In Eudamed, the SSCP is associated to one or multiple Basic UDI-DI(s). All UDI-DIs/devices associated to this Basic UDI-DI will be seen as having the same SSCP (a UDI-DI/device must always be associated with one and only one Basic UDI-DI).

If the device is a system of several components/devices, each device in the system  should  have  a  Basic  UDI-DI  but  also  one  Basic  UDI-DI  for  the system. It is the Basic UDI-DI for the system that is intended to be provided in section  1.4  in  the  template,  and  that  will  be  associated  with  the  SSCP  in Eudamed. The device system, and any Basic UDI-DIs of included devices, should be described in section 3.1.

The device description in the SSCP  shall therefore include all the device(s)/device system  associated with the same  Basic  UDI-DI.  The description of the device(s)/device system should be comprehensive and can be presented in different ways to include, if such exist, any configurations / combinations  /  different  sizes  /  specification  of  any  soft-ware  versions  that can be related to safety and/or performance and their release dates / etc.

The description should also include any model number or similar designation used to identify the device(s)/device system.

- 3.2.  A  reference  to  previous  generation(s)  or  variants  shall  be  provided,  if  such exist. This applies both to changes/variants of the device itself (same Basic UDI-DI) and to previous generation(s) or variants associated with other Basic UDI-DIs,  if  available.  A  description  of  the  differences  shall  be  provided, highlighting the reasons for the change; for example changes to the intended clinical  benefits,  changes  to  reduce  identified  clinical  risks,  or  changes  for manufacturing reasons etc.
- 3.3.  If  there  are  any  accessories 54   that  are  not  themselves  devices,  but  are intended by the manufacturer to be used in combination with the device, they shall be described or listed. The list of accessories should include all those that are essential for the safe and correct use of the device.
- 3.4.  If  there  are  any  other  devices  and  products  intended  to  be  used  in combination  with  the  device,  they  shall  be  described  or  listed.  However, generic surgical equipment and/or other generic devices do not need to be listed.

In the part of the SSCP that is intended for patients, section 3 may be limited to the  device(s)  in  question  (Basic  UDI-DI)  including  relevant  and  necessary accessories from a patient's perspective; see suggested headings for section 3 in the template in the Appendix.

### 4. Information  on  any  residual  risks  and  any  undesirable  effects,  warnings and precautions

## 4.1.  Residual risks and undesirable effects

This section of the SSCP guide and template includes residual risks 55 , other than  those  contraindications,  limitations,  warnings  and  precautions  that  are included in sections 2.3 and 4.2.

## Description of residual risks and undesirable effects

Risk  is  defined  in  the  MDR 56   as  the  combination  of  the  probability  of occurrence  of  harm  and  the  severity  of  that  harm.  Harm  is  defined  in  the standard  ISO  14971:2012 57   as  physical  injury  or  damage  to  the  health  of people,  or  damage  to  property  or  the  environment.  Thus  the  term  'risk' includes both clinical and non-clinical harms.

The term 'residual risk' is defined in the standard ISO 14971:2012 58  as 'risk remaining after risk control measures have been taken'.

There is a requirement in the MDR that the IFU shall contain information on any residual risks and any undesirable side-effects 59 , i.e. no sort of residual risk or undesirable  side-effect related to  the  device  is  excluded  from disclosure.  The  SSCP  should  contain  information  on  at  least  the  same residual risks and undesirable side-effects as included in the IFU.

For the purpose of the SSCP, an undesirable effect 60  can be understood as any undesirable side-effect related to the device and that is experienced by the patient and/or can be diagnosed and/or measured in the patient.

For the clarity of the SSCP, undesirable side-effects can be annotated also in other terms as appropriate, to present any undesirable side-effects related to the  device in question.  There  may  be  device-specific  terminology for describing side-effects and risks in device-specific ISO standards or scientific literature that is important to use to allow comparison of clinical data.

For  example,  some  events  indicated  in  the  MDR  by  the  terms  'adverse events' 61 ,  'undesirable side-effects' or 'incidents' 62 , may all be annotated as 'adverse events' in the scientific literature.

Any further discussion on risks can be included in the SSCP if needed for clarity or comprehension.

## Quantitative data

The  definition  of  risk 63   includes  the  probability  of  occurrence  of  harm. Therefore the information in the SSCP  on risks shall also include quantifications. This information can be sourced from the clinical evaluation report where an updated examination of qualitative and quantitative aspects of  clinical  safety  is  available,  with  clear  reference  to  the  determination  of residual risks and side-effects 64 .

It  should  also  be  clarified  in  the  SSCP  whether  quantitative  data  on  sideeffects or residual risks relate to clinical data that were obtained proactively, for example from a structured prospective follow-up study of the device itself, or  if  the  expected  frequencies 65   come  from  a  systematic  review  of  the scientific literature. It  should  be disclosed in the  SSCP  if data  from spontaneously reported incidents or serious incidents 66  are used as one of the sources for estimating quantitative data on side-effects or residual risks, in which case significant under-reporting needs to be considered.

A relation to time should also be included when presenting the quantitative data,  for  example  during  five  or  ten  years  of  use  from  implantation,  or adverse events per 100 patient-years for implantable devices with constant hazards, etc. The quantitative data and the relation to time should always be presented together.

To use tabulated lists for the presentation of side-effects and residual risks with quantitative data and a relation to time, may enhance the readability.

In the part of the SSCP that is intended for patients, residual risks and sideeffects  should  be  explained  and  quantified  in  a  way  that  patients  and  lay persons can understand. A statement should be included about how potential risks have been controlled or managed, and also a statement on what to do if the  patient  believes  that  he/she  is  experiencing  side-effects  related  to  the device or its use. See the example in the template in the Appendix.

- 4.2.  All  warnings and precautions pertaining to the device should be presented. However warnings and precautions solely related to for example installation/preparation of a device or relating to special procedural steps can be discussed on a general level in the SSCP if a link (URL) to the IFU on the manufacturer's website is provided.

Always include any  warnings,  precautions  or  measures  to  be  taken  by  the patient or a healthcare professional with regard to reciprocal interference with reasonably foreseeable external influences, medical examinations or environmental conditions.

If any particular clinical follow-up is necessary and mentioned in the IFU, that information should also be included in the SSCP.

- 4.3.  Other relevant aspects of safety should be described. If the device has been subject to any field safety corrective action (FSCA including FSN), the date of the FSCA and a summary of the associated circumstances and any actions undertaken should also be included.

### 5. The summary of clinical evaluation as referred to in Annex XIV, and relevant information on post-market clinical follow-up

This  part  of  section  5  relates  to  content  intended  for  the  user/healthcare professional.

This section is intended to summarise, in a comprehensive manner, the clinical evaluation  results  and  the  clinical  data 67 forming  the  clinical  evidence 68 for  the confirmation of conformity with relevant general safety and performance requirements 69 , the evaluation of undesirable side-effects and the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio 70 .

It shall be an objective and balanced summary of the clinical evaluation 71  results of  all  the  available  clinical  data  related  to  the  device  in  question,  whether favourable, unfavourable, and/or inconclusive.

See suggested headings for this section in the Appendix of this document.

- 5.1.  The  SSCP  should  include  a  statement  if  conformity  of  the  device  was assessed and endorsed  by the NB  on  the basis of equivalence. If equivalence  was  used,  then  the  device(s)  for  which  equivalence  has  been demonstrated  should  be  identified  by  name  and  Basic  UDI-DI  if  available, together with the name(s) of its/their manufacturer(s).

The SSCP should also include a statement whether the equivalent device's SSCP is available in Eudamed. If not available in Eudamed, the SSCP should include  a  summary  of  the  clinical  data  pertaining  to  the  equivalent  device, written in accordance with the recommendations of this section 5, with a clear note  that  it  relates  to  the  equivalent  device.  It  should  be  evident  from  the summary what the clinical evidence for the equivalent device was based on: whether it was clinical investigations of that device itself, or if any other data were used and then the sources of that data. Also include a summary of how long-term safety and  performance  of the equivalent device  has  been confirmed.

- 5.2.  All clinical investigations of the device in question, conducted before the CEmarking, should be summarised. It is recommended to keep the format clear by grouping the information for each study. The summary  of each investigation should include the following non-exclusive list:

- Identity of the investigation/study: If performed under the Medical Device Directives  or  the  MDR,  then  give  the  CIV  ID  or  single  identification number.    Add  reference  details  if  the  clinical  investigation  report  is available in Eudamed 72 . For other studies, the title of the study and a clear reference to a clinical trials database or publication where detailed data on the study can be found (7) 73  should be included. In the circumstance that the investigation/study was conducted outside EU, identify the country/-ies where it was performed.
- Identity of the device including any model number/version
- Intended use of the device in the investigation
- Objectives of the study
- Study  design:  randomised  controlled  trial,  other  pivotal  trial,  short-term feasibility study, other; and the duration of the follow-up
- Primary and secondary endpoint(s)
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria for subject selection
- Number of enrolled subjects, including if applicable in different treatment arms
- Study  population:  main  baseline  characteristics  of  each  study  group, including gender and age of enrolled subjects
- Summary of study methods
- Summary of results: any clinical benefits 74 ; any undesirable side-effects or adverse  events,  and  their  frequency  in  relation  to  time;  any  results  on long-term benefits or risks, for example implant survival rates at 5 or 10 years  and/or  cumulative  experience  in  patient-years.  A  statement  of percentage completeness of follow-up should be provided. Add a note if the study is still ongoing for long-term follow up.
- Any limitations  of  the  study,  such  as  high  loss  to  follow-up,  or  potential confounding factors that may question the results.
- Any  device  deficiency  and  any  device  replacements  related  to  safety and/or performance during the study.
- 5.3.  Summary of other clinical data and the main findings pertaining to the device itself should be included if available.

This can be sourced 75  for example from:

- A  systematic  literature  review  yielding  articles  in  which  the  device  in question  was  used.  References  to  these  articles  should  be  provided.  A bibliography can be added at the end of the SSCP document if there are many references.
- Clinically  relevant  information  based  on  clinical  data  obtained  from  the implementation of the manufacturer's PMCF and PMS plans, such as:
- Conducted PMCF investigation(s) 76 ; include information on each study as outlined in section 5.2 in this guide.

- New  or changed likelihood of an undesirable side-effect(s), or significant  increase  in  the  frequency  or  severity  of  incidents,  or  any identified trends 77 , or any other main findings from  the  PMCF evaluation report or PSUR 78 .
- Analysis  of  clinical  data  from  medical  device  registries.  Any  known limitations such as incomplete follow-up should be disclosed.
- 5.4.  An  overall  summary  of  the  clinical  performance 79   and  safety  should  be provided, and that is supported by clinical evidence 80 , based on clinical data and the clinical  evaluation  results  pertaining  to  the  device  in  question.  It  is recommended that the overall summary should include the following:
- The clinical performance normally leads to clinical benefits for the patient. Give a description  of  the  documented  clinical  benefits 81   for  patients  with relevant and specified clinical outcome measures, and the success rate for achieving the outcome measures. This should be described for all clinical claims  the  manufacturer  presents  in  the  IFU,  and  in  any  information, marketing, or promotional material that it distributes. For a non-absorbable implant, there should also be information about the expected lifetime of the device including data on implant survival rates.
- Benefit-risk assessment for the various indications including the acceptability  of  the  benefit-risk  ratio 82 .  This  includes  a  summary  of  the evaluation of undesirable side-effects.

In the case  of a device without an  intended medical  purpose 83 , the requirement to  demonstrate clinical benefit shall be understood as a requirement to demonstrate the performance of the device. The summary of the clinical evaluation shall be based on relevant data concerning safety and performance 84 .

- 5.5.  The SSCP shall have a section on planned or ongoing PMCF 85  that should include the following (non-exclusive list):
- Summary of the  latest  approved  PMCF  plan for  the  device.  Include  any planned  or  ongoing  studies  (brief  description),  and  if  there  are  any unanswered questions relating to the use of the device and how they will be investigated.
- If  any  emerging  risks,  complications  or  unexpected  device  failures  have been detected, and how these will be followed up.

The information on clinical evaluation and PMCF intended for patients, in section 5

The  part  of  the  SSCP  intended  for  patients  should  be  provided  with  a  brief summary which enables the patient to understand the basis upon which clinical safety  and  performance  has  been  demonstrated.  The  summary  should  include the following (non-exclusive list):

- Clinical background of the device

A  description  of  the  relative  novelty  of  the  device:  if  the  product  has  a proven clinical track record of safety and performance, or if there are one or more novel design features.

- The clinical evidence for the CE marking

A  description  whether  clinical  evidence  is  based  on  data  concerning  an equivalent  device,  on  data  collected  during  a  clinical  investigation  of  the device itself, or on a combination of the two. A short lay-summary of the clinical  investigations  performed  on  the  device  itself  should  be  given,  if such  exist.  If  there  are  clinical  investigation  reports  on  the  device  itself available  in  Eudamed,  this  should  be  stated  and  identification  numbers should be given 86  (CIV ID or single identification number). The summary should  not  make  misleading  claims  regarding  the  strength  of  clinical evidence, either by direct reporting or omission.

- Safety
- A  description  of  the  benefit-risk  assessments  related  to  safety  and performance for each indication claimed by the manufacturer, including information to address benefit-risk issues of interest to specific patient populations, if applicable.
- A description of how the manufacturer continuously collects information on  safety  and  performance  and  in  particular  if  any  clinical  studies (PMCF) are ongoing or planned. A description of the purpose of any such  studies,  for  example  to  corroborate  safety  and  performance claims based on equivalence data, or to demonstrate long-term safety.

### 6. Possible diagnostic or therapeutic alternatives

This  part  of  the  SSCP  document  should  contain  a  review  of  how  the  device relates, in terms of benefit-risk, to diagnostic or therapeutic alternatives and the specific conditions under which the device and its alternatives can be considered 87 .

If reference is made to the 'state of the art', that statement should be supported for  example by referring  to relevant recognised guidance documents generated by specialty medical societies or educational bodies.

In  the  part  of  the  SSCP  intended  for  patients  the  text  should  include  a recommendation  to  discuss  any  possible  diagnostic  or  therapeutic  alternatives with  a  healthcare  professional  who  can  take  into  consideration  the  individual patient's situation. See the proposed text in the template in the Appendix.

### 7. Suggested profile and training for users

The  experience,  education  and/or  training  of  the  intended  user(s)  shall  be described 88 .  This  includes  any  specific  mandatory  training  before  using  the device, and any update training for continued safe use of the device.

If the device is intended to be handled directly by the patient, section 7 should be included in the SSCP part intended for patients and any required training should be described.

### 8. Reference to any harmonised standards and CS applied

A  list  with  all  applied  common  specifications  (CS),  international  standards harmonised  under  the  Medical  Device  Directives  (2)(3)  and/or  the  MDR,  and relevant  adopted  monographs  of  the  European  Pharmacopoeia 89   shall  be provided.

The  year/revision  of  the  applied  CS,  standard  or  monograph,  should  be  listed together with information whether it was applied in full or in part.

The year/revision of an applied harmonised standard or CS may change in the technical  documentation  for  the  device.  However,  an  update  of  the  SSCP concerning this change can wait until the next revision of the SSCP is issued.

This list in section 8 does not need to be included in the part of the SSCP that is intended for patients.

### 9. Revision history

The SSCP document should include a revision history. The purpose is to include the following information:

- The SSCP revision number
- Date when the revision was issued
- Description of the main changes
- In which language the SSCP was validated by the NB
- In  case  of  a  SSCP  on  class  IIa  implantable  or  some 90   IIb  implantable devices; whether the SSCP revision has been validated yet or not by the NB

See an example of a table for a Revision history in the Appendix of this guide.
