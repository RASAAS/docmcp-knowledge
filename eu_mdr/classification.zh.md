# **EU MDR Classification Rules**

**ANNEX  VIII. CLASSIFICATION RULES**

## CHAPTER I. DEFINITIONS SPECIFIC TO CLASSIFICATION RULES

### 1.   DURATION OF USE

1.1 ‘Transient’ means normally intended for continuous use for less than 60 minutes.

1.2 ‘Short term’ means normally intended for continuous use for between 60 minutes and 30 days.

1.3 ‘Long term’ means normally intended for continuous use for more than 30 days.

### 2.   INVASIVE AND ACTIVE DEVICES

2.1 ‘Body orifice’ means any natural opening in the body, as well as the external surface of the eyeball, or any permanent artificial opening, such as a stoma.

2.2 ‘Surgically invasive device’ means:  
(a) an invasive device which penetrates inside the body through the surface of the body, including through mucous membranes of body orifices with the aid or in the context of a surgical operation;  
(b) a device which produces penetration other than through a body orifice.

2.3 ‘Reusable surgical instrument’ means an instrument intended for surgical use in cutting, drilling, sawing, scratching, scraping, clamping, retracting, clipping or similar procedures, without a connection to an active device and which is intended by the manufacturer to be reused after appropriate procedures such as cleaning, disinfection and sterilisation have been carried out.

2.4 ‘Active therapeutic device’ means any active device used, whether alone or in combination with other devices, to support, modify, replace or restore biological functions or structures with a view to treatment or alleviation of an illness, injury or disability.

2.5 ‘Active device intended for diagnosis and monitoring’ means any active device used, whether alone or in combination with other devices, to supply information for detecting, diagnosing, monitoring or treating physiological conditions, states of health, illnesses or congenital deformities.

2.6 ‘Central circulatory system’ means the following blood vessels: arteriae pulmonales, aorta ascendens, arcus aortae, aorta descendens to the bifurcatio aortae, arteriae coronariae, arteria carotis communis, arteria carotis externa, arteria carotis interna, arteriae cerebrales, truncus brachiocephalicus, venae cordis, venae pulmonales, vena cava superior and vena cava inferior.

2.7 ‘Central nervous system’ means the brain, meninges and spinal cord.

2.8. ‘Injured skin or mucous membrane’ means an area of skin or a mucous membrane presenting a pathological change or change following disease or a wound.

## CHAPTER II. IMPLEMENTING RULES

3.1 Application of the classification rules shall be governed by the intended purpose of the devices.

3.2 If the device in question is intended to be used in combination with another device, the classification rules shall apply separately to each of the devices.  Accessories for a medical device shall be classified in their own right separately from the device with which they are used.

3.3 Software, which drives a device or influences the use of a device, shall fall within the same class as the device.  
If the software is independent of any other device, it shall be classified in its own right.

3.4 If the device is not intended to be used solely or principally in a specific part of the body, it shall be considered and classified on the basis of the most critical specified use.

3.5 If several rules, or if, within the same rule, several sub-rules, apply to the same device based on the device’s intended purpose, the strictest rule and sub-rule resulting in the higher classification shall apply.

3.6 In calculating the duration referred to in Section 1, continuous use shall mean:  
(a) the entire duration of use of the same device without regard to temporary interruption of use during a procedure or temporary removal for purposes such as cleaning or disinfection of the device. Whether the interruption of use or the removal is temporary shall be established in relation to the duration of the use prior to and after the period when the use is interrupted or the device removed;  
(b) the accumulated use of a device that is intended by the manufacturer to be replaced immediately with another of the same type.

3.7 A device is considered to allow direct diagnosis when it provides the diagnosis of the disease or condition in question by itself or when it provides decisive information for the diagnosis.
