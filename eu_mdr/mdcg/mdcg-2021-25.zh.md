Substantial changes are in particular in sections 3.1, 3.2 and 4, namely: - clarification that Article 19 MDR does not apply to legacy devices; - clarification of the application of the transitional provisions to systems and procedure packs covered by a declaration drawn up pursuant to Article 12(2) MDD; - clarification regarding the requirement to put in place a QMS in accordance with Article 10(9) MDR. |

## 1. Introduction

The  transitional  provisions  of  Regulation  (EU)  2017/745  on  medical  devices  (MDR) have been amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/607. In particular, the transitional period has been extended from 26 May 2024 until 31 December 2027 or 31 December 2028, depending on the risk class of the device and subject to certain conditions 1 .

This  document  provides  updated  guidance  as  regards  the  applicability  of  MDR requirements  to  'legacy  devices'  and  'old'  devices,  taking  into  consideration  the amendments to the MDR transitional provisions 2 . The annex contains a non-exhaustive table illustrating MDR requirements applicable or not applicable to 'legacy devices'.

## 2. Legal provisions and terminology

## 2.1. Legal provisions

Article 120(3) to (3e) of the MDR as amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/607 states:

- '3.    By  way  of  derogation  from  Article 5  and  provided  the  conditions  set  out  in paragraph 3c of this Article are met, devices referred to in paragraphs 3a and 3b of this Article may be placed on the market or put into service until the dates set out in those paragraphs.
- 3a.  Devices which have a certificate that was issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC and that is valid by virtue of paragraph 2 of this Article may be placed on the market or put into service until the following dates:
- (a) 31 December  2027,  for  all  class  III  devices,  and  for  class  IIb  implantable devices  except  sutures,  staples,  dental  fillings,  dental  braces,  tooth  crowns, screws, wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips and connectors;
- (b) 31 December 2028, for class IIb devices other than those covered by point (a) of this paragraph, for class IIa devices, and for class I devices placed on the market in sterile condition or having a measuring function.
- 3b.  Devices for which the conformity assessment procedure pursuant to Directive 93/42/EEC did not require the involvement of a notified body, for which the declaration of conformity was drawn up prior to 26 May 2021 and for which the conformity assessment  procedure pursuant to this Regulation requires the involvement of a notified body, may be placed on the market or put into service until 31 December 2028.
- 3c.  Devices referred to in paragraphs 3a and 3b of this Article may be placed on the market or put into service until the dates referred to in those paragraphs only if the following conditions are met:
- (a) those devices continue to comply with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC, as applicable;
- (b) there are no significant changes in the design and intended purpose;

- (c) the  devices  do  not  present  an  unacceptable  risk  to  the  health  or  safety  of patients, users or other persons, or to other aspects of the protection of public health;
- (d) no  later  than  26 May  2024,  the  manufacturer  has  put  in  place  a  quality management system in accordance with Article 10(9);
- (e) no later than 26 May 2024, the manufacturer or the authorised representative has  lodged  a  formal  application  with  a  notified  body  in  accordance  with Section  4.3,  first  subparagraph,  of  Annex  VII  for  conformity  assessment  in respect  of  a  device  referred  to  in  paragraph  3a  or  3b  of  this  Article  or  in respect  of  a  device  intended  to  substitute  that  device,  and,  no  later  than 26 September  2024,  the  notified  body  and  the  manufacturer  have  signed  a written  agreement  in  accordance  with  Section  4.3,  second  subparagraph,  of Annex VII.
- 3d.  By  way  of  derogation  from  paragraph  3  of  this  Article,  the  requirements  of  this Regulation  relating  to  post-market  surveillance,  market  surveillance,  vigilance, registration of economic operators and of devices shall apply to devices referred to in paragraphs 3a and 3b of this Article in place of the corresponding requirements in Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC.
- 3e.    Without prejudice to Chapter IV and paragraph 1 of this Article, the notified body that issued the certificate referred to in paragraph 3a of this Article shall continue to be  responsible  for  the  appropriate  surveillance  in  respect  of  the  applicable requirements relating to the devices it has certified, unless the manufacturer has agreed with a notified body designated in accordance with Article 42 that the latter shall carry out such surveillance.

No  later  than  26 September  2024,  the  notified  body  that  has  signed  the  written agreement referred to in paragraph 3c, point (e), of this Article shall be responsible for  the  surveillance  in  respect  of  the  devices  covered  by  the  written  agreement. Where the written agreement covers a device intended to substitute a device which has  a  certificate  that  was  issued  in  accordance  with  Directive 90/385/EEC  or Directive 93/42/EEC, the surveillance shall be conducted in respect of  the device that is being substituted.

The arrangements for the transfer of the surveillance from the notified body that issued the certificate to the notified body designated in accordance with Article 42 shall be clearly defined in an agreement between the manufacturer and the notified body designated in accordance with Article 42 and, where practicable, the notified body that issued the certificate. The notified body designated in accordance with Article 42 shall not be responsible for conformity assessment activities carried out by the notified body that issued the certificate.

## 2.2. Terminology used in this guidance

Legacy devices should be understood as devices, which, in accordance with Article 120(3) of the MDR, are placed on the market or put into service after the MDR's date of application (DoA) and until either 31 December 2027 or 31 December 2028 if the conditions set in Article 120(3c) of the MDR are fulfilled 3 . Those devices can be:

- devices which are class I devices under Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD), for which an  EC  declaration  of  conformity  was  drawn  up  prior  to  26  May  2021  and  for which  the  conformity  assessment  procedure  under  the  MDR  requires  the involvement of a notified body;
- devices covered by a valid 4  EC certificate issued in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC (AIMDD) or the MDD prior to 26 May 2021.

'Old' devices are those devices that were placed on the market or put into service before 26 May 2021 in accordance with the AIMDD or the MDD or in accordance with the applicable rules before the Directives had entered into force.

MDR devices are those that are placed on the market or put into service as being in conformity with the MDR other than 'legacy devices'.

It  should  be  recalled  that  the  concept  of  'placing  on  the  market'  refers  to  each individual product, not to a type of product 5 .

## 3. Application of MDR requirements to 'legacy devices'

## 3.1. Requirements relating to post-market surveillance, market surveillance, vigilance, registration of economic operators and of devices

In accordance with Article 120(3d) of the MDR, the requirements of the MDR relating to post-market  surveillance, market  surveillance, vigilance, registration  of  economic operators and of devices apply to 'legacy devices'. This provision is the same as in the initial version of the MDR and has not been changed by Regulation 2023/607.

That means that all relevant MDR requirements set out in Chapter VII of the MDR on post-market surveillance, market  surveillance  and  vigilance  apply to  'legacy  devices'. To  determine  the  applicability  of  requirements  which  depend  on  the  risk  class  of  a device (e.g. Article 85 or Article 86 of the MDR) the legacy device's risk classification in accordance with the MDD should be taken into account. A possible change of their risk class under the MDR is relevant only for determining the end of the transitional period. Active  implantable  devices  and  their  accessories  subject  to  the  AIMDD  should  be

considered  as  class  III  devices  for  the  purpose  of  applying  the  relevant  MDR requirements during the transition period.

In  addition  to  the  requirements  set  out  in  Chapter  VII  MDR,  also  other  MDR requirements  related  to  post-market  surveillance,  market  surveillance,  vigilance, registration of economic operators and devices should apply to 'legacy devices'.

Such an approach respects the wording of Article 120(3d) of the MDR. At the same time, it extends the application of the MDR to those requirements that support a wellfunctioning vigilance and market surveillance system as well as proper registration of economic operators and devices.

Firstly, the general obligations of manufacturers and importers to place only devices on the market that are in conformity with the MDR (Articles 10(1) and 13(1)  of the MDR) apply, whereas for 'legacy devices' conformity with the MDR means conformity with the MDD or AIMDD and the additional requirements in accordance with Article 120(3d) of the MDR. In addition, the obligations of economic operators set out in the following provisions should also apply to economic operators with respect to 'legacy devices': 6

- for manufacturers: Article 10(10), (12)-(15);
- for authorised representatives 7 : Article 11(3)(c)-(g);
- for importers: Article 13(2), 2 nd  subparagraph, (4), (6)-(8), (10);
- for distributors: Article 14(2), last subparagraph, (4)-(6).

MDR  requirements that are not related to post-market surveillance, market surveillance,  vigilance,  registration  of  economic  operators  and  devices  should  in principle not apply to economic operators in respect to 'legacy devices'. Examples for provisions not applicable in respect to 'legacy devices' are Article 15, Article 16(3) and (4), Article 18 8 ,  Article  19 9 ,  Article  25 10 ,  Article  27 11 ,  Article  32.  This  is  without prejudice to the possibility for economic operators to follow any MDR  requirements also for 'legacy devices', especially if they deal with both 'legacy devices' and MDR devices and want to apply the same procedures for all devices.

## Systems and procedure packs

Following the logic of the transitional provisions laid down in Article 120(2) and (3) of the MDR, the transitional period also applies to systems and procedure packs:

- for which involvement of a notified body is required pursuant to the MDR,
- which consist only of 'legacy devices' 12  and
- for which a declaration has been drawn up in accordance with Article 12(2) of the MDD prior to 26 May 2021 13 .

In  such  cases,  Article  22  of  the  MDR  does  not  apply.  The  transitional  period  for  a 'legacy  system  or  procedure  pack'  ends  when  the  transitional  period  ends  for  the legacy device of the highest risk class according to the MDR that is included in the system  or  procedure  pack.  This  also  applies  where  a  certificate  was  issued  by  a notified body prior to 26 May 2021 in accordance with Article 12(3) MDD, unless the certificate has been withdrawn.

A system or procedure pack that is to be treated as a device in its own right pursuant to  the  last  subparagraph  of  Article  12(2)  MDD  needs  to  meet  all  the  applicable requirements and conditions set out in Article 120(3) to (3d) MDR to benefit from the extended transitional period.

## 3.2. Other MDR requirements

## Putting in place a MDR compliant quality management system

In  accordance with Article  120(3c), point  (d),  of  the  MDR, manufacturers must  put  in place  a quality  management system (QMS) in  accordance  with  Article 10(9)  of  the MDR no later than 26 May 2024 in order to be allowed to place their 'legacy devices' on the market after that date. That means that, since 26 May 2024, manufacturers must comply with Article 10(9) of the MDR, in addition to the requirements relating to postmarket surveillance, market surveillance, vigilance, registration of economic operators and of devices, which were applicable already from 26 May 2021. With regard to legacy devices,  compliance  of  the  QMS  with  the  MDR  does  not  need  to  be  certified  by  a notified  body  by  26  May  2024,  as  the  assessment  of  the  QMS  will  be  done  by  the notified body as part of the MDR certification.

For some specific QMS aspects listed in Article 10(9) of the MDR, e.g. points (b), (e) and (f), it needs to be taken into consideration that the QMS covers 'legacy devices', i.e. devices that are not yet (fully) MDR compliant. That means that for those devices it is  not  required  that  manufacturers  have  identified  all  relevant  general  safety  and performance requirements and options to address those requirements, or have put in place  a  risk  management  system  as  set  out  in  Section  3  of  Annex  I  MDR,  nor conducted  the  clinical  evaluation  in  line  with  Article  61  and  Annex  XIV  of  the  MDR.

However,  the  manufacturer's  QMS  should  address  how  compliance  with  those requirements will be achieved during the transitional period.

## UDI assignment

As Article 10(9), point (h), of the MDR does not in itself establish a requirement for UDI assignment, the verification of UDI assignments only applies where UDI assignment is actually  required  for  the  relevant  devices.  As  mentioned  in  MDCG  2019-5,  'legacy devices' are not subject to the MDR UDI requirements. This approach has not changed through Regulation 2023/607 14 .

## 4.  Application of MDR requirements to devices placed on the market prior to 26 May 2021 ('old' devices)

Serious incidents involving an 'old' device and field safety corrective actions (FSCA) in respect of 'old' devices must be reported in accordance with Article 87 MDR.

Furthermore, Articles 93 to 100 of the MDR, which lay down rights and obligations of competent authorities with regards to market surveillance activities is also applicable to 'old' devices as this allows competent authorities to check that those devices are in conformity with the rules applicable at the moment when they were placed on the market and to take appropriate measures against non-compliant or unsafe devices.

1. See Q&amp;A document on practical aspects related to the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/607.
2. This guidance concerns only legacy devices under the MDR; for guidance on IVD legacy devices, please consult MDCG 2022-8 IVD legacy devices (europa.eu).
3. To provide guidance for manufacturers and other actors in deciding whether or not a device is covered by the extended transitional period provided for in Article 120 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR), as amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/607, see flowchart. Products falling outside the scope of the MDR (e.g. products referred to in Article 1(6), point (h), MDR) cannot be subject to an application or a written agreement for conformity assessment with a notified body in accordance with Section 4.3 of Annex VII MDR, so that they do not benefit from the extended transitional period.
4. See Article 120(2) MDR regarding the extended validity of certificates.
5. See  Article  2(28)  MDR  and  Section  2.3.  of  the  Commission  Notice  -  The  'Blue  Guide'  on  the implementation of EU products rules 2022, OJ C 247, 29.6.2022, p. 1.
6. In all cases, 'conformity with the requirements of this Regulation' shall mean for 'legacy devices' conformity with the MDD or AIMDD and the additional requirements in accordance with Article 120(3d) MDR.
7. The requirement that manufacturers not established in the EU shall designate an authorised representative (Article 11(1) MDR) stems already from the AIMDD and MDD and therefore also applies to 'legacy devices'. For the purpose of clearly identifying the relevant competent authority, Article 11(7) should be applied also in respect of 'legacy devices' clarifying that any reference to the competent authority of the Member State in which the manufacturer has its registered place of business shall be understood as a reference to the competent authority of the Member State in which the authorised representative has its registered place of business.
8. Without prejudice to national rules on implant cards applicable to 'legacy devices'.
9. For legacy devices, the Declaration of Conformity (DoC) needs to refer to the MDD or AIMDD, as applicable. The manufacturer may additionally declare conformity with Article 120 MDR confirming that the conditions laid down therein are fulfilled. Where the manufacturer updates its DoC to reflect changes regarding information provided in the declaration (e.g. changes concerning the address, the authorised representative, or the validity date) the manufacturer should add a reference to the DoC which was drawn up for the legacy device before 26 May 2021. In addition, traceability of all versions of the DoC needs to be ensured.
10. Without prejudice to traceability requirements in the supply chain applicable to 'legacy devices' in accordance with other rules such as on market surveillance of goods or the General Product Safety Directive.
11. See in this respect also MDCG 2019-5 on registration of legacy devices in EUDAMED.
12. Including devices that used to be part of a system or procedure pack as 'legacy device' and that meanwhile have demonstrated compliance with the MDR without having undergone significant changes in design or intended purpose.
13. Including any combinations of legacy devices covered by the Article 12(2) statement.
