## Introduction

The sponsor of a clinical investigation is required to submit an application/notification 1 to  the Member State(s) in which a clinical investigation is to be conducted, accompanied by the documentation referred to in Chapter II of Annex XV of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR). 2  The application/notification is required to be submitted by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 73 of the MDR.

In  the  absence  of  the  European  database  on  medical  devices  (EUDAMED),  a  series  of  clinical  investigation application/notification documents have been created to support clinical investigation procedures with respect to MDR.

These documents include:

- Clinical investigation - application/notification form under the MDR
- Addendum to the clinical investigation application/notification form for:
- o Additional investigational device(s) (section 3)
- o Additional comparator device(s) (section 4)
- o Additional investigation site(s) (section 5)
- Clinical investigation supporting documents - Appendix of documents to attach
- Checklist of general safety and performance requirements, Standards, common specifications and scientific advice

Insofar as possible, the clinical investigation application/notification form includes same data fields to the EUDAMED system in development.

For further guidance with respect to the application of certain MDR provisions during the absence of EUDAMED please see MDCG 2021-1 Rev.1. 3  In the absence of EUDAMED, the Union-wide unique single identification number for a clinical investigation, which shall be used for all relevant communication in relation to that clinical investigation will be  the  CIV-ID  which  is  currently  used  for  Eudamed2,  the  electronic  system  which  supports  the  medical  device Directives. 4

## Use of templates

These  documents  are  intended  to  be  facilitative  and  their  use  by  the  Competent  Authorities  and  sponsors  is encouraged, however it is important to check with the individual Member State in which the clinical investigation is planned to be conducted as to any specific national requirements. It is planned that these templates will be withdrawn once the EUDAMED module for clinical investigations is fully functional. Further operational guidance with respect to the use of the guidance may be provided in due course.
